Therefore, a certain amount of solar energy strikes a relatively small area. So, areas near the equator have higher temperatures than areas farther away from the equator do. When the flashlight is shined perpendicularly to the paper, the light strikes a relatively small area.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/ms_cnlese814295_214a2.png","imageAlt":""},{"title":"Near the Poles","description":"Near the poles, sunlight hits Earth indirectly.
