As a result, the air over the water is cooler than the air over land. Convection transfers energy as the cool air flows toward land and causes warm air to rise.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/default.svg","imageAlt":""}]},"isPracticeInteraction":false,"AllowFullScreen":true,"AudioFromRCE":true,"AllowRefresh":true,"audioFile":"../../../../captions/audio/368a6c17873a42ec89b02a95b5757f92.json","audioSchema":"hot_spot_audio_schema.json"}
