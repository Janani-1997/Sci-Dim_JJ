When the bottle was capped at the higher elevation, a low number of air particles was trapped inside the bottle. As the car drove to a lower elevation, the air pressure outside of the bottle increased&nbsp;and pushed inward on the bottle, causing it to collapse inward.</p>","FinalVOFeedback":"","AudioFromRCE":true,"qtype":"mcq","AllowFullScreen":true,"AllowRefresh":true,"ShowAnswerOption":true,"SubmitToTeacherOption":false,"optionsAreImages":false,"hasInstantFeedback":false,"hasCustomAttempts":true,"MaxAttempts":2,"Stimulus":{"image":{"src":"","credits":""},"text":{"src":""},"audio":{"src":"","caption":"","credit":""},"video":{"src":""}},"audioFile":"../../../../captions/audio/6955db9d63f549a0aab83fae966dd7de.json","audioSchema":"mcq_audio_schema.json"}
