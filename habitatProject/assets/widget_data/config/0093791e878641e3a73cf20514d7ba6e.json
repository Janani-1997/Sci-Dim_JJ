Sample answer: Sunlight is more intense at the equator than at the poles. This results in warmer climates near the equator. Differences in the sunâ€™s intensity also play a part in the formation of belts of high and low air pressure, which produce dry and wet climates at different latitudes.","id":"inputData","userData":"","no-feedbackText":"","feedbackText":"","questionImage":""}}
