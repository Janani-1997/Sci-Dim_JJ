Sample answer: Air temperature is how hot or cold air is. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cold air. If there is a certain amount of water vapor in the air, and the temperature drops until the air becomes saturated, the water vapor will condense.","id":"inputData","userData":"","no-feedbackText":"","feedbackText":"","questionImage":""}}
