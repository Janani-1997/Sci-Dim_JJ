Taproots can access water deeper in the soil, which makes the plant more tolerant to drought. Taproots are also larger and used to store nutrients. Fibrous roots spread out more and protect the soil from erosion.","correctHint":""},"options":[{"image":"","id":"Target1","shape":"Circle","left":37.04188481675393,"top":6.9576284668823245,"width":"25.73216623036649%","height":"84.6474089763722%"},{"image":"","id":"Target2","shape":"Circle","left":60.47120418848168,"top":10.050031041156922,"width":"26.255726439790575%","height":"85.81601723697185%"},{"image":"","id":"Target3","shape":"Circle","top":10,"left":10,"width":"29.135307591623036%","height":"84.41799519545752%"}],"voiceOver":"","tipText":"","downloadLink":"","instantFeedback":false,"teacherAnswer":"","questionImage":"","image":"../../../../img/cards/ms_cnlese814264_6l10230_1.png","layout":"main","answerType":"Text","draggables":[{"id":"drag1","text":"anchors plant","image":"","target":"Target1"},{"id":"drag2","text":"absorbs water","image":"","target":"Target1"},{"id":"drag3","text":"stores nutrients","image":"","target":"Target3"},{"id":"drag4","text":"drought tolerant","image":"","target":"Target3"},{"id":"drag5","text":"absorbs nutrients","image":"","target":"Target1"},{"id":"drag6","text":"protects soil","image":"","target":"Target2"}]}}
