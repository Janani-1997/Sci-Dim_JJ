The 3 and 4 represent the surface area and the 1 represents the volume. So, moving from one ratio to the other, the volume doesn't change and the surface area gets bigger. Think about how this would affect the transport of materials across the cell membrane.</p>"},{"AnswerText":"<p class=\"quill-source-editor\">D.
