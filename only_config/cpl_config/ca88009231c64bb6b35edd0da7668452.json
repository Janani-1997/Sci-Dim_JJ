A stamen consists of an anther, the pollen-producing part of the flower. The anther sits on top of a thin stalk. The anther produces spores that develop into pollen.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""},{"title":"Pistil","description":"The pistil is the female reproductive structure of a flower. A pistil consists of the stigma, the style, and the ovary. The stigma is often sticky or covered in hairs. This makes it easier to collect pollen. The ovary contains the ovules, which produce eggs. After fertilization, the ovules develop into seeds. The ovary develops into a fruit.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/cynognathus_fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""},{"title":"Pollinator","description":"As pollinators feed on nectar, pollen, and fruit, pollen from a flower&rsquo;s anther rubs off on their bodies. When they fly to a second flower, pollen from the first flower rubs off on the second flower&rsquo;s stigma. Meanwhile, pollen from the second flower&rsquo;s anther rubs off on the pollinators&rsquo; bodies, ready to be delivered to another flower.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/cynognathus_fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""}]},"isPracticeInteraction":false,"AllowFullScreen":true,"AudioFromRCE":true,"AllowRefresh":true,"audioFile":"../../../../captions/audio/ca88009231c64bb6b35edd0da7668452.json","audioSchema":"hot_spot_audio_schema.json"}
