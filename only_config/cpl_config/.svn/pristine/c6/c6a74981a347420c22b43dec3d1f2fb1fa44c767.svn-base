Plant cells have rigid cell walls, which help to provide structure and support for the plant. Plant cells also have a nucleus and other organelles.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""},{"title":"Plant Cells","description":"Each plant cell contains chloroplasts that capture the sun's energy to power the process of photosynthesis. Plant cells also contain mitochondria, organelles that provide the cells with oxygen.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/cynognathus_fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""},{"title":"Plant Tissues","description":"The cells in a plant are organized into three tissue types. <em>Dermal tissue</em> protects the plant, <em>vascular tissue</em> transports materials, and <em>ground tissue</em> provides support and storage.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/cynognathus_fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""},{"title":"Plant Organs","description":"Leaves, stems, roots, and flowers are all plant organs made up of the three tissue types.

The shoot system includes the leaves, stems, and flowers. The root system takes up water and nutrients from the soil.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/default.svg","imageAlt":""}]},"isPracticeInteraction":false,"AllowFullScreen":true,"AudioFromRCE":true,"AllowRefresh":true,"audioFile":"../../../../captions/audio/baa29de89b8e4fb2997a61933c75e6f2.json","audioSchema":"hot_spot_audio_schema.json"}
