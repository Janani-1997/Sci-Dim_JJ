Sample answer: A microscope can be used to display samples of organisms to show that all living things are made of cells and that cells are the building blocks of life. Some of the samples will show unicellular organisms, and some will show multicellular organisms. A microscope can also be used to show cells dividing, which would show that cells come from preexisting cells.","id":"inputData","userData":"","no-feedbackText":"","feedbackText":"","questionImage":""}}
