Pollen is produced here. Mature male cones release pollen into the air. Pollen often travels by wind.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""},{"title":"Female Cone","description":"The female cone has a pair of ovules on each scale. Pollination occurs when pollen reaches an egg inside an ovule. After they are pollinated, the fertilized eggs will develop into seeds. The seeds are dispersed when the cone breaks apart.","image":"../../../../../img/cards/cynognathus_fossil.jpg","imageAlt":""}]},"isPracticeInteraction":false,"AllowFullScreen":true,"AudioFromRCE":true,"AllowRefresh":true,"audioFile":"../../../../captions/audio/779c7591c99b410ab008c3f03c8f060a.json","audioSchema":"hot_spot_audio_schema.json"}
