Chloroplasts in plant cells convert energy from sunlight into food energy that the plant consumes. Mitochondria in both plant and animal cells convert sugars into energy the cell and organism can use. Cell membranes protect the cell, give it structure, and control what goes into and out of the cell. Cell walls in plant cells provide structure to the cell.","id":"inputData","userData":"","no-feedbackText":"","feedbackText":"","questionImage":""}}
