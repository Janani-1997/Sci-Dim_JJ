All offspring produced using these plants as parents will have only purple flowers for many generations. This analysis can take place over a shorter period of time than growing plants and waiting for them to flower.</p>","FinalVOFeedback":"","AudioFromRCE":true,"qtype":"mcq","AllowFullScreen":true,"AllowRefresh":true,"ShowAnswerOption":true,"SubmitToTeacherOption":false,"optionsAreImages":false,"hasInstantFeedback":false,"hasCustomAttempts":true,"MaxAttempts":2,"Stimulus":{"image":{"src":"","credits":""},"text":{"src":""},"audio":{"src":"","caption":"","credit":""},"video":{"src":""}},"audioFile":"../../../../captions/audio/4caff85c484546b7bd661a1607193d5e.json","audioSchema":"mcq_audio_schema.json"}
