{"ActivityTitle":"","QuestionStem":"<p class=\"quill-source-editor\">One way that plants respond to their environment is by growing in response to gravity, or <em>gravitropism</em>. Roots grow toward the direction of the gravitational pull (downwards). Stems grow opposite to the gravitational pull (upwards). The force of gravity is very weak on the space station, a condition referred to as <em>microgravity</em>. How might microgravity affect the growth of plants on the space station? Select all that apply.</p>","VOIntro":"","Tip":"","Summary":"","options":[{"AnswerText":"<p class=\"quill-source-editor\">A.
