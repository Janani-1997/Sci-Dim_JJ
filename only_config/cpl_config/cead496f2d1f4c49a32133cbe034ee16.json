Very sensitive fingers, toes, and lips enable a person to know whether something that is being touched or eaten is harmful. A personâ€™s toes help with balance, so a person must be aware of any unevenness of the ground. Other body parts, such as the forearm, back, and calf, do not need as much sensitivity because people do not usually use them to sense the external environment."}}
