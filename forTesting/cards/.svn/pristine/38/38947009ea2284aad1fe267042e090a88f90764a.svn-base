        <p data-uuid="3d99cedba7f743c6b7230a7b390f09fa">The Sixth Amendment protects the rights of a person who has been indicted. It guarantees that person a speedy public trial. Public trials ensure that laws are being followed by allowing the public to witness the proceedings. Accused people have the right to know the charges against them and can hear and question witnesses testifying against them. Accused people have the right to an attorney. If they cannot pay for legal service, the government must provide it. Sometimes accused persons refuse their Sixth Amendment rights. For example, some defendants refuse the services of an attorney, while others choose to have a trial in front of a judge alone instead of before a jury. In many cases, defendants can forgo trial and agree to a plea bargain. This means that a defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge and avoids risking conviction for a crime with a greater sentence.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f1a32b926e3e488b9510ff78d8a8f807">The Eighth Amendment allows for bail. Bail is a set amount of money that defendants promise to pay the court if they fail to appear in court at the proper time.</p>
        <p data-uuid="928af30721cf41e1b2066b680039e1bb">By posting, or paying, bail, a defendant can avoid staying in jail before and during a trial. If a defendant does not show up in court for trial, the court demands the bail money be paid and issues a warrant for arrest.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0c613a6d3dd54f72ae509ce9355e0ef1">The Eighth Amendment keeps courts from setting unfairly high bail. However, in cases of very serious crimes, a judge may refuse to set bail altogether. This can be the case, for example, if the court regards a defendant as being potentially dangerous to the public by being left free. A judge can also deny bail if he or she thinks the defendant will not show up for trial. In such cases the defendant must remain in jail through the trial.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="3515a193c9e44e2d825f7b66676b0721">“Cruel and Unusual Punishments”</h3>
        <p data-uuid="914c80e8c90e426ba2cd5e06c3035466">The Eighth Amendment also bans “cruel and unusual punishments” against a person convicted of a crime. For many years, Americans have debated the question of what exactly constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The debate has often centered on the issue of capital punishment. In 1972 the Supreme Court ruled that the way in which most states carried out the death penalty was cruel and unusual. The Court also found that the ways in which many states sentenced people to death were unfair. However, a few years later, the Court ruled that not all executions were in themselves cruel and unusual.</p>
        <p data-uuid="02b6001de33a43bfb5db209fe0bf5433">Most states still allow the death penalty. Those that do must follow the Supreme Court’s rules. To do so, many states have changed the ways in which they carry out the death penalty.</p>
