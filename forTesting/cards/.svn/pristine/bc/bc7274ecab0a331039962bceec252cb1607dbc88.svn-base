He gave Japanese leaders gifts and tried to show some of the benefits that Japanese-American trade would have. For instance, Perry presented them with a telegraph transmitter and a model train. This effort—and the presence of U.S. naval power—persuaded Japanese officials to open trade with the United States. The two countries signed a trade agreement in 1858.<br />

This began a 40-year period of modernization. By the 1890s Japan was becoming a major imperial power. It defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War from 1894 to 1895. As a result, Japan gained new territory and enjoyed the same trading privileges in China as European countries. In 1904 Japan attacked Russian forces stationed in China. President Theodore Roosevelt helped to negotiate a peace treaty to end the Russo-Japanese War a year later. Japan gained control of Korea, a lease on Port Arthur in China, and other rights. Japan had become a world power.<br />

To promote its national interests, the United States took action. In 1899 Secretary of State John Hay sent notes to Japan and many European countries announcing the <b><dfn title="Open Door Policy">Open Door Policy</dfn></b>. This policy stated that all nations should have equal access to trade in China. The policy was neither rejected nor accepted by European powers and Japan, but it made U.S. intentions clear.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a813a52104964eea805b9121bbaa322c"> As a result, many Chinese resented the power and control held by foreign nations. This hostility sparked the <b><dfn title="Boxer Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</dfn></b>. The Boxers were Chinese nationalists who were angered by foreign involvement in China. In their language, the group was called the Fists of Righteous Harmony. Westerners called them Boxers because they used a clenched fist as their symbol. Although officially denounced, they were secretly supported by the Chinese government.<br />

        <p data-uuid="a3976bf38bc745e78945d42683de9d51"> The siege continued for two months. Foreign military forces, including United States Marines, fought their way from the port of Tianjin to Beijing. There they invaded the Forbidden City, the imperial palace complex. The Boxers were soon defeated. China was forced to make a cash payment of $333 million to foreign governments, $25 million of which went to the United States. Secretary of State Hay then sent another Open Door note to Japan and the European nations. The Open Door Policy remained in effect until World War II again closed China’s borders to foreign influence.<br />
