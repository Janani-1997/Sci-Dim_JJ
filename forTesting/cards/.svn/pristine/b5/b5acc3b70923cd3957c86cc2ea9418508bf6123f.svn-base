Mr. Madison comes not. May God protect us! Two messengers, covered with dust, come to bid me fly; but here I mean to wait for him. . . At this late hour a wagon has been procured, and I have had it filled with plate and the most valuable portable articles, belonging to the house. Whether it will reach its destination, the "Bank of Maryland," or fall into the hands of British soldiery, events must determine. Our kind friend, Mr. Carroll, has come to hasten my departure, and in a very bad humor with me, because I insist on waiting until the large picture of General Washington is secured, and it requires to be unscrewed from the wall. This process was found too tedious for these perilous moments; I have ordered the frame to be broken, and the canvas taken out. It is done! and the precious portrait placed in the hands of two gentlemen of New York, for safe keeping. And now, dear sister, I must leave this house, or the retreating army will make me a prisoner in it by filling up the road I am directed to take. When I shall again write to you, or where I shall be tomorrow, I cannot tell!<br />

        <p data-uuid="2112ecf02d474a6c949a6ed73b0b27be">After the attack on Washington, the British moved against New Orleans. British commanders hoped to capture the city and thus take control of the Mississippi River.</p>
        <p data-uuid="985a9bad437f42a4944bf1aa2773c030">Andrew Jackson commanded the U.S. forces around New Orleans. His troops were a mix of regular soldiers, including two battalions of free African Americans, a group of Choctaw Indians, state militia, and pirates led by Jean Lafitte.</p>
        <p data-uuid="929437a0cf1848d9882566be0b28bd39">The battle began on the morning of January 8, 1815. Some 5,300 British troops attacked Jackson’s force of about 4,500. The British began marching toward the U.S. defenses, but they were caught on an open field. The British were cut down with frightening speed. More than 2,000 British soldiers were killed or wounded. The Americans, for their part, had suffered about 70 casualties. The <b><dfn title="Battle of New Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</dfn></b> made Andrew Jackson a hero and was the last major conflict of the War of 1812.</p>
        <p data-uuid="54d1e96bccb24131bf2f065973035174">By then, however, a peace treaty had been signed between the United States and Great Britain. American and British diplomats were eager for peace. The Napoleonic Wars had been costly for England. In America, New Englanders were near rebellion over the toll the war had taken. While no territory changed hands as a result of the War of 1812, America had proved itself as a nation.</p>
