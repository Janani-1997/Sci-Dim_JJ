            1500 West Africa was well known for its trading kingdoms. Since ancient times,
            despite the dangers of the Sahara, trade routes crisscrossed West Africa. For
            many years, <b><dfn title="Berbers">Berbers</dfn></b>, a group
            of people from northern Africa, controlled these routes. In time, however, a
            series of three great trading empires arose thanks to the control of the salt
            and gold trades. Ghana (GAH-nuh) was the first of these empires.</p>

        <p data-uuid="49ff54d14d6c450ebe6ddd34aa015479">Historians
            think the first people in Ghana were farmers along the Niger River. Sometime
            after AD 300, these farmers, the Soninke (soh-NING-kee), were threatened by
            nomadic herders. The herders wanted to take the farmers’ water and pastures.
            For protection, groups of Soninke families began to band together. This
            banding together was the beginning of Ghana.</p>

            was in an ideal position to become a trading center. To the north lay the vast
            Sahara, the source of much of the region’s salt. Ghana itself was rich in gold.
            People wanted gold for its beauty, but they needed salt in their diets to
            survive. Salt, which could be used to preserve food, also made bland food
            tasty. These qualities made salt very valuable. In fact, Africans sometimes cut
            up slabs of salt and used the pieces as money.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f413fbaa6b3c4a6384f065951f949c17">As
            the gold and salt trade increased, Ghana’s rulers gained power. Eventually,
            they built up armies equipped with iron weapons that were superior to the
            weapons of nearby people. Over time, Ghana conquered its neighbors and took
            control over trade in the region.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2bb9f8c4eb65483c8f69f29e6512de97">By 800
            Ghana was firmly in control of West Africa’s trade routes. Nearly all trade
            between northern and southern Africa passed through Ghana. With so many traders
            passing through their lands, Ghana’s rulers looked for ways to make money from
            them. One way they raised money was by forcing traders to pay taxes. All
            traders who entered Ghana had to pay a special tax on the goods they carried.
            Then they had to pay another tax on any goods they took with them when they
            left. Ghana’s rulers gained incredible wealth from trade, taxes on traders and
            on the people of Ghana, and their own personal stores of gold. They used their
            wealth to build an army and an empire.</p>

        <p data-uuid="97d55e6732d2409497d753460b5950b2">Extensive
            trade routes brought the people of Ghana into contact with people of many
            different cultures and beliefs. As the kingdom of Ghana extended into the
            Sahara, increased contact with Arab traders from the east brought the
            religion of Islam to Ghana.</p>
        <p data-uuid="464a380dee6b4143938800a6baa11904">
            Islam
            was founded in the 600s by an Arab man named Muhammad. Muslims, followers of
            Islam, believe that God had spoken to Muhammad through an angel and had made
            him a prophet, someone who tells of God’s messages. After Muhammad’s death, his
            followers wrote down his teachings to form the book known as the Qur’an. Islam
            spread quickly through the Arabian Peninsula. By the mid-seventh century,
            traders had already helped spread Islam to northern Africa.</p>

            the 1060s a Muslim group called the Almoravids (al-muh-RAH-vuhdz) attacked
            Ghana in an effort to force its leaders to convert to Islam. The Almoravids
            weakened Ghana’s empire and cut off many trade&#160;routes.</p>

            Without

            The influence of Islam, however, remained strong. By the late 1400s Islam would
            become the most practiced religion in the region.</p>
