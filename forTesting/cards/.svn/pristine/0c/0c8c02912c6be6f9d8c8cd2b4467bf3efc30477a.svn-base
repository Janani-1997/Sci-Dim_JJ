        <p data-uuid="f2231fe8be924047ac8de3f08f647338">With a booming economy and exciting forms of entertainment, the 1920s became known as the Roaring Twenties. An explosion in the popularity of jazz music gave the decade another nickname—the <b><dfn title="Jazz Age">Jazz Age</dfn></b>.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f778b2210e6d4b9ab314ca26d1313845">Jazz developed in New Orleans. African American musicians in this city blended spirituals with European harmonies and West African rhythms. When African Americans moved north during the Great Migration, they brought their music with them.</p>
        <p data-uuid="25c2463465d5476d953399de66bfa790"> As with many new forms of popular culture, jazz sparked arguments between older and younger generations. “When my grandmother found out that I was playing jazz music . . . she told me that I had disgraced the family,” remembered “Jelly Roll” Morton, an early jazz composer. But young Americans loved the music and the wild, fast-paced dances that went along with it. Dance crazes sweeping the nation included the Charleston, the Toddle, and the Shimmy. New magazines arose that taught dance steps to subscribers.<br />

        <p data-uuid="0d5aa659bb10435c9998814b014cf519">Jazz musicians such as Louis Armstrong experimented with various sounds and rhythms to create a new kind of music. Armstrong, who played the trumpet, was known for his solo numbers. His method of stepping out from the band to perform a solo was an innovation that musicians today still copy. Another major figure of the Jazz Age in the United States was conductor and composer Edward “Duke” Ellington. His “big band” sound blended many instruments together in songs such as “Take the A Train.” Ellington described the exciting life of Jazz Age musicians in New York City:<br />

        <p data-uuid="5f625330f1bc4f609b06aaf118f307e1">Blues music came from the rural South of the Mississippi delta. It also gained national popularity in the 1920s. Blues began as an expression of the suffering of African Americans during slavery. One of the leading blues singers of the 1920s was Bessie Smith, nicknamed the Empress of the Blues. “She had music in her soul,” said Louis Armstrong.
