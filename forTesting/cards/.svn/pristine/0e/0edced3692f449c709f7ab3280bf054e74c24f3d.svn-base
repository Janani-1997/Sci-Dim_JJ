        <p data-uuid="9b659e3f5c6147bdbc36a8615ba6b19a">Miners and settlers were increasing in numbers—and they wanted Indians’ land. The U.S. government tried to avoid disputes by negotiating the <dfn title="Treaty of Fort Laramie">Treaty of Fort Laramie</dfn>, the first major treaty between the U.S. government and Plains Indians. Two years later, several southern Plains nations signed a treaty at Fort Atkinson in Nebraska. These treaties recognized Indian claims to most of the Great Plains. They also allowed the United States to build forts and roads and to travel across Indian homelands. The U.S. government promised to pay for any damages to Indian lands.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="66492d93b2934e40aae4e47f02c4f961">The treaties did not keep the peace for long. In 1858 the discovery of gold in what is now Colorado brought thousands of miners to the West. They soon clashed with the Cheyenne and the Arapaho. In 1861 the U.S. government negotiated new treaties with Plains Indians. These treaties created <dfn title="reservations">reservations</dfn>, areas of federal land set aside for Native Americans. The government expected Indians to stay on the reservations, which made hunting buffalo almost impossible.</p>

In 1877, when the U.S government ordered the Nez Perc&#233; to relocate to a reservation, Joseph at first agreed, but then was forced to flee. He attempted to escape into Canada with about 750 of his people. On a courageous journey across Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, they defeated pursuing troops who greatly outnumbered them.
