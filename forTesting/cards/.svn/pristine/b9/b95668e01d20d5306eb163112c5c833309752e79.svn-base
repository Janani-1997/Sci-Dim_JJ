        <p data-uuid="fdd3abca19eb436b98b4cdc48708b727">Japanese Americans faced a different form of prejudice during World War II. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, some Americans began to look at Americans of Japanese descent with fear and suspicion. Most Japanese Americans lived on the West Coast at this time. It was feared that they would serve as secret agents for Japan and help Japan prepare an invasion of the West Coast or try to sabotage U.S. war efforts.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b4e05cf2d90f474282231f15795888d4"> The U.S. government had no evidence to support these fears. In spite of this fact, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. This order allowed the government to begin the process of <b><dfn title="internment">internment</dfn></b>, or forced relocation and imprisonment, of Japanese Americans. About 115,000 Japanese Americans were evacuated from their homes and held in isolated internment camps.&#160;Half of those held in the camps were children. A smaller number of Americans of German and Italian ancestry were also held in internment camps during the war.<br />

        <p data-uuid="63c0072cafcb4e57a5ae75382b990a51">Fred Korematsu, a Japanese American citizen, refused to go to the camps and was arrested as a result. Saying that the internment order was unlawful and racist, Korematsu took his case all the way to the Supreme Court. In <i>Korematsu </i>v. <i>United States </i>(1944), the Supreme Court ruled against him, arguing that the unusual demands of wartime security justified the order.<br />

        <p data-uuid="630d698542844fa582233de82c697701">At this time, some Japanese Americans were <i>Issei</i>, or immigrants born in Japan. But most were <i>Nisei</i>, American citizens born in the United States to Japanese immigrant parents. Whether they were U.S. citizens or not, Japanese Americans lost their jobs, homes, and belongings when they were forced to move to internment camps. A farm owner named Yuri Tateishi spoke of feeling betrayed by his government. “You hurt,” he said. “You give up everything that you worked for that far, and I think everybody was at the point of just having gotten out of the Depression and was just getting on his feet. And then all that happens! You have to throw everything away.” After the Pearl Harbor attack, the government banned young Japanese American men from serving in the military. But Roosevelt reversed this policy in 1943.<br />
