        <p data-uuid="3fc668ff1d8d4285b9b95f8c72b5df60">The United States also
            had disputes along its southern border with Spanish Florida. After the War of
            1812, the Seminoles in Florida continued to welcome runaway slaves from the
            United States. In turn, Americans continued to enter Florida. Some came as
            settlers, and others came to capture escaped slaves. Encounters between these
            Americans and the Seminoles were unfriendly. From 1817 to 1818, the Seminoles
            and their African American allies fought against Americans in a series of small
            battles that came to be known as the First Seminole War.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6ca0d5277db44e43871b6d77797edf0b">
            In April 1818, under General Andrew Jackson,
            U.S. troops invaded Florida. They drove out the Seminoles living in East
            Florida near the Georgia border, as well as those living west of the Suwannee
            River. Jackson wrote to the United States government that “the possession of
            Florida would be desirable [good] . . . and in sixty days it will be accomplished.”<br />

                    Andrew Jackson earned
                    the nickname “Old Hickory” during the War of 1812. Soldiers called him that
                    because he was strict. They said he was as tough as the wood of a hickory tree.&#160;</p>

        <p data-uuid="f31fa9d738244e70bc3afc06b58d159c">Then, believing that he had the
            permission of the U.S. government, Jackson seized the Spanish forts at St.
            Marks and Pensacola. Spain objected to Jackson’s actions. The United States
            said that Jackson had acted without authority and returned to Spain the forts
            that Jackson had captured. Still, Jackson’s campaign showed that Spain’s hold
            on Florida was loosening.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b8ea7a4b81a443ca96e8ecf54899c409">Jackson’s
            presence in Florida convinced Spain to negotiate with the United States over
            the ownership of Florida. On February 22, 1819, U.S. Secretary of State John
            Quincy Adams, son of John and&#160;Abigail Adams, and Spanish diplomat Luis de On&#237;s
            signed the <b><dfn title="Adams-On&#237;s Treaty">Adams-On&#237;s
            Treaty</dfn></b>, which settled all border disputes between Spain
            and the United States. Spain agreed to give Florida to the United States. In
            return, the United States gave up its claims to what is now Texas and agreed to
            pay up to $5 million of U.S. citizens’ claims against Spain.&#160;</p>
