        <p data-uuid="1f69c953f7c44294b6e15a7755f93cb6">President Herbert Hoover tried to calm public fears by assuring Americans that the economy was still strong. “The fundamental business of the country . . . is on a sound and prosperous basis,” he said. But this was just the beginning of more than ten years of economic hard times.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e07cb5e55aca4da8ba6e55b95f62658e">The Banking Crisis</h3>
        <p data-uuid="7d1caf9f736449069e615c1bcc59f2fd">One immediate effect of the stock market crash was a banking crisis. Banks had invested heavily in the stock market, so they lost heavily when the market crashed. Banks had also lent their customers money to buy stocks on margin. Now those customers were unable to pay back their loans. Some banks went out of business. People who had deposited their life savings in those banks lost everything.<br />

        <p data-uuid="293195bab1ad42e6aa28c42ebcf9cfe6">This created a panic all over the country, as customers rushed to their banks to withdraw their money. But since banks usually do not keep enough cash on hand to cover all deposits, the banks soon ran out of money. Many had to close their doors. In 1931 alone, more than 2,200 banks closed. The banking crisis contributed to a business crisis. Some businesses lost their savings in failed banks and had to close. Others were forced to cut back production, which meant they needed fewer workers. Nearly 3 million people lost their jobs. In the last three months of 1929, U.S. unemployment soared from under half a million workers to more than 4 million. </p>

        <p data-uuid="555897133a37460580ebdc8752979c89">Throughout the history of the United States, the economy has followed a pattern of ups and downs. When businesses produce more than they can sell, unsold goods pile up. Businesses then cut back on their production and lay off workers. People who have lost their jobs, and others who are afraid they might soon lose their jobs, buy fewer goods. This causes more businesses to fail. This economic event is called a recession. Deep and long-lasting recessions are known as depressions. </p>
        <p data-uuid="41a4dc8650624effa9fd1c0b024d397b">As time passes, an economy will tend to bounce back. Consumers buy surplus goods, and companies increase production to meet the demand. Soon, more workers are hired and unemployment drops. This up-and-down pattern, known as the <b><dfn title="business cycle">business cycle</dfn></b>, continues in today’s economy. </p>
        <p data-uuid="4eb9917b12e94e65bece3e64a8d2d5a3"> The United States had experienced recessions and depressions before 1929. Each time, the economy followed the business cycle and recovered. But the economy did not recover quickly from the downturn that began in 1929. Because of its severity and length, it was called the <b><dfn title="Great Depression">Great Depression</dfn></b>.<br />

        <p data-uuid="586baefa40b243278b69161e135051f8">Historians and economists still debate the exact causes of the Great Depression. Some believe that the government’s monetary policy was a cause. Others believe that limited market competition and protectionism, or restriction of trade, played a part. However, most agree that a major factor was the overproduction of goods at a time when the market for those goods was shrinking. Companies built millions of cars and appliances during the 1920s. By the late 1920s, however, most people who could afford these products already had bought them. That meant that American businesses were producing far more goods than people were consuming. </p>
        <p data-uuid="b5dbdd2f5fbd4a59b2aed49a038f054b">Uneven distribution of wealth made this problem worse. In 1929 the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans earned one-third of all income, while the bottom 40 percent earned only one-eighth of all income. Millions of Americans simply did not earn enough money to buy expensive new products. Many of them lost their jobs, their wealth, and their homes.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5c54a80985ae4e67840776a689847326"> Declining world trade also hurt American manufacturers. Europeans were still recovering from World War I and could not afford many American goods. At the same time, high tariffs made it difficult for European nations to sell products to the United States. As a result, Europeans had even less money to buy American goods.<br />
