        <p data-uuid="539019bb900246e3b018c88d33d962e4">In the early 1900s a reformer named Marie van Vorst took a series of jobs in factories and clothing mills around the country. She wanted to investigate working conditions for children by living and working alongside them. In a South Carolina textile mill, van Vorst met children as young as seven years old. She described working with one young child:</p>

        <p data-uuid="9edf5fa1e2354b66b6f1a5173d8ad63e">This girl—and other children like her—provided cheap labor for manufacturers. Some children were paid as little as 40 cents a day. Marie van Vorst helped focus attention on the problem of child labor. Eliminating the problems of child labor became a major issue for Progressives and other reformers.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ddb294f67af54a759fe2a6563529f55c">Children did many jobs in the late 1800s. Boys sold newspapers and shined shoes on the streets. Girls often cooked or cleaned for boarders staying with their families. Girls also worked at home with their mothers, sewing clothes or making handicrafts.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2566687ee85c449a9719a14c30b97f6d"> Like the child van Vorst encountered, many children worked in industry. In 1900 more than 1.75 million children age 15 and under worked in factories, mines, and mills. Those children earned very low wages in often dangerous conditions.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6b45c64d78c74a5b84af9fc3575507aa">As reporters published shocking accounts of working conditions for children, more people became aware of the problem. Progressives began to call for new reforms. For instance, reformer Florence Kelley served as a board member of the National Consumers’ League, the major lobbying group for women’s and children’s labor issues. A lobbying group works to influence legislators in favor of a cause.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b51e0def7dd5450c96d436010b9cbcd7">During the early 1900s, reformers finally succeeded in getting some laws passed to ease the conditions of child laborers. In 1912 the state of Massachusetts passed the first minimum wage law and a commission was created to establish rates for child workers.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f86f9921c71941d0abe63716bd8ae67f">In 1916 and 1919 Congress passed federal child labor laws. The laws banned products made with child labor from being shipped from one state to another. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the laws were unconstitutional. The Court argued that the laws went beyond the federal government’s legal power to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d7365f67a27347b68754664367902ca2"> In any case, laws alone could not end child labor. Some parents ignored child labor laws so that their children could continue contributing to the family income. Children were often instructed to lie about their age to government inspectors and tell them they were older than they really were.<br />
