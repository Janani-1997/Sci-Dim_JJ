Roosevelt, who won four times, was the only president to serve more than two terms. Now, the Twenty-Second Amendment limits presidents to two terms. If a president dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president for the rest of the term.</p>

Impeachment cases are tried in the Senate. If a president is found guilty, Congress can remove him from office. In 1868 Andrew Johnson was the first president to be impeached. President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998. However, the Senate found each man not guilty.</p>

In 2003 the office became the Department of Homeland Security, the newest executive department.</p>
