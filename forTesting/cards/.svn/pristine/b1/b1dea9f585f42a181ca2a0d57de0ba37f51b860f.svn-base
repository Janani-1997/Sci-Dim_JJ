            <p data-uuid="2887ac238e1f4ddda40b23bbc723ef9c"> Elizabeth Cady Stanton was born in Johnstown, New York. She married a prominent abolitionist and settled in Seneca Falls, New York, where she had seven children. Later in life she traveled widely, giving lectures and speeches across the country. Stanton and fellow activist Lucretia Mott organized the nation’s first women’s rights convention, at Seneca Falls in 1848. She and Susan B. Anthony founded the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869. For nearly six decades, she spoke and wrote passionately about women’s rights. Stanton helped author the Declaration of Sentiments, which demanded equal rights for women, including the right to vote. A brilliant speaker and debater, Stanton spoke out against laws that kept married women from owning property, earning wages, and keeping custody of their children.</p>

Apparently, even many abolitionists did not think that women were equal to men. Stanton and Mott wanted to change this, so they planned to “form a society to advance the rights of women.” Eight years passed before Stanton and Mott finally announced the <dfn title="Seneca Falls Convention">Seneca Falls Convention</dfn>, the first public meeting about women’s rights held in the United States. It opened on July 19, 1848, in Seneca Falls, New York.</p>

This document detailed beliefs about social injustice toward women. They used the Declaration of Independence as the basis for the language for their Declaration of Sentiments. The authors included 18 charges against men—the same number that had been charged against King George III. The Declaration of Sentiments was signed by some 100 people.<br />

Many other reformers who also worked in the temperance and abolitionist movements were present. Several women who participated in the convention worked in nearby factories. One of them, 19-year-old Charlotte Woodward, signed the Declaration of Sentiments. She worked long hours in a factory, making gloves. Her wages were very low, and she could not even keep her earnings. She had to turn her wages over to her father.<br />

        <p data-uuid="dce450877eed4df6bb0bc58a1038beb5">After the convention, the struggle continued. Women’s rights activists battled many difficulties and much opposition. Still, they kept working to obtain greater equality for women. Among the many women working for women’s rights, four became important leaders: Lucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage, and &#173;Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Each brought different strengths to the fight for women’s rights.</p>

In the early years of the women’s rights movement, Stone became known as a gifted speaker. Elizabeth Cady Stanton called her “the first who really stirred the nation’s heart on the subject of women’s wrongs.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="26be3c26ff654acba170409ea11ad822"><dfn title="Anthony, Susan B.">Susan B. Anthony</dfn> brought strong organizational skills to the women’s rights movement. She did much to turn the fight for women’s rights into a political movement. Anthony argued that women and men should receive equal pay for equal work. She also believed that women should be allowed to enter traditionally male professions, such as religion and law. Anthony was especially concerned with laws that affected women’s control of money and property.</p>

        <p data-uuid="a10909a2c7394159a1d12db7bc2d4a11"> Anthony led a campaign to change laws regarding the property rights of women. She wrote in her diary that no woman could ever be free without “a purse of her own.” After forming a network to cover the entire state of New York, she collected more than 6,000 signatures to petition for a new property-rights law. In 1860, due largely to the efforts of Anthony, New York finally gave married women ownership of their wages and property. Other states in the Northeast and Midwest soon created similar laws.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="26530e4f561d49c2af159aecbc20c09c">Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote many of the documents and speeches of the movement, which were often delivered by Anthony. Along with Lucy Stone and <dfn title="Gage, Matilda Joslyn">Matilda Joslyn Gage</dfn>, Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869. This organization was considered one of the more radical groups because of its position that abolition was not a more important cause than women’s rights.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e1a9bcc9130645d79ced11246a1e5f73"> Matilda Joslyn Gage was a writer and an advocate in New York. After cofounding the NWSA, she became the publisher of its official newspaper, the <i>National Citizen and Ballot Box</i>. She also worked with Stanton and Anthony to write and edit <i>History of Woman Suffrage</i>.</p>
