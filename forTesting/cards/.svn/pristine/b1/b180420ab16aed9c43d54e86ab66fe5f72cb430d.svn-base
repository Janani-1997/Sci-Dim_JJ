        <p data-uuid="615e2dbb3ea2443f857184144282da58">By the time U.S. troops started to arrive in Europe in 1917, the Allies were dangerously near defeat. German forces were advancing in France, once again driving toward Paris. The German navy was destroying Allied ships at sea. And on the eastern front, the Russians were desperately struggling to hold back the Germans.<br />

        <p data-uuid="dd4da08a28464e8fb75d93ae196bfd7e">French and British generals called for immediate help on the front lines. They wanted the U.S. troops, known as the <b><dfn title="American Expeditionary Force">American Expeditionary Force</dfn></b> (AEF), to join French and British units. But General John J. Pershing, leader of the American troops, insisted that the Americans join the fight as a separate force. He refused to have the AEF “scattered among the Allied forces where it will not be an American army at all.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="15af6cea3b564e29ae75c5d89f816b70">Pershing also demanded that his troops be thoroughly trained for combat before rushing to the front lines. The AEF included many well-trained regular army and National Guard troops. But it also included a large number of inexperienced volunteers and draftees. Pershing gave the men three months of intense training in army discipline and trench warfare. He believed that taking the time to train his soldiers would help the Allies achieve victory.<br />

        <p data-uuid="d81c205578474a64bc38b7475044e4fe">While Pershing trained his troops, the Allies’ position became even more dangerous. In November 1917 a group of Russians called the Bolsheviks overthrew the Russian government and seized power. The Bolsheviks were <b><dfn title="Communists">Communists</dfn></b>—people who favor the equal distribution of wealth and the end of all forms of private property.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0ef4aebde01945d0b4edff71019cc5cb"> Led by Vladimir Lenin, the new Russian government faced a desperate situation. Around 8 million Russians had been killed or wounded during the war. Soldiers were deserting from the eastern front, and sailors were leaving naval bases. Food riots raged in the cities. The Russians could not keep fighting under these conditions. In March 1918 Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, a peace agreement with the Central powers. A civil war then broke out in Russia between the Communists and forces loyal to the czar (ZAHR), Russia’s emperor. The United States and other Allied countries sent aid to the czarist forces. Russia, however, one of the main Allied powers, was out of World War I.<br />
