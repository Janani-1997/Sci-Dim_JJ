        <p data-uuid="be0fae2558644086b34216dbf13b0dc3">While industrialization continued to grow in the North, some leaders worried that the South was depending too much on cotton. They wanted southerners to try a variety of cash crops and investments.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="3287593adfc1410e9b425c60d2d5e186">Food and Cash Crops</h3>
        <p data-uuid="df9a1f23e33b4be89697cb27e3675007">One such crop was corn, the primary southern food crop. By the late 1830s the top three corn-growing states in the nation were all in the South. The South’s other successful food crops included rice, sweet potatoes, wheat, and sugarcane.</p>

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="4f8bc11245924b60a49baf68eb2443d4"> Corn, the South’s main food crop, was used in dishes such as grits and succotash.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e4719390749841c696858b738f64d72f">Production of tobacco, the South’s first major cash crop, was very time consuming. Tobacco leaves had to be cured, or dried, before they could be shipped to market. In 1839 a slave discovered a way to improve the drying process by using heat from burning charcoal. This new, faster curing process increased tobacco production.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d24e2cfe66bd470ba66b4854ad601661">Partly as a result of the cotton boom, hemp and flax also became major cash crops. Their fibers were used to make rope and sackcloth. Farmers used the rope and sackcloth to bundle cotton into bales.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="42eabe9027f3427094e8e883425ddecf">Industry</h3>
        <p data-uuid="bcce1c3d8a6b45b2af975d2db37fcd38">Many of the first factories in the South were built to serve farmers’ needs by processing crops such as sugarcane. In 1803 the nation’s first steam-powered sawmill was built in Donaldsonville, Louisiana. This new technology enabled lumber companies to cut, sort, and clean wood quickly.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e43b21033d954d2ea741c39c462a0f70">By the 1840s entrepreneurs in Georgia began investing in cotton mills. In 1840 there were 14 cotton mills. By the mid-1850s there were more than 50. A few mill owners followed the model established by Francis Cabot Lowell. However, most built small-scale factories on the falls of a river for waterpower. A few steam-powered mills were built in towns without enough waterpower.</p>

In 1848 Anderson became the owner of the <b><dfn title="Tredegar Iron Works">Tredegar Iron Works</dfn></b> in Richmond, Virginia. Tredegar was one of the most productive ironworks in the nation. It was the only factory in the South to produce products such as cannons, steam engines, and bridge materials.</p>

Southern industry faced stiff competition from the North and from England, both of which could produce many goods more cheaply. And as long as agricultural profits remained high, southern investors preferred to invest in land.</p>
