        <p data-uuid="0322164caf7c468e81912f16ef02184e">In 1858 John Brown tried to start an uprising. He wanted to attack the federal arsenal in Virginia and seize weapons there. He planned to arm local slaves. Brown expected to kill or take hostage white southerners who stood in his way. He urged abolitionists to give him money so that he could support a small army. But after nearly two years, Brown’s army had only about 20 men.</p>

        <p data-uuid="24de600c902a48c788c1c6acbe54a947">On the night of October 16, 1859, <b><dfn title="John Brown’s raid">John Brown’s raid</dfn></b> began when he and his men took over the arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in hopes of starting a slave rebellion. He sent several of his men into the countryside to get slaves to join him. However, enslaved African Americans did not come to Harpers Ferry, fearing punishment if they took part. Instead, local white southerners attacked Brown. Eight of his men and three local men were killed. Brown and some followers retreated to a firehouse.</p>
        <p data-uuid="aee7c48b6edf473e9d49c286bef479de">Federal troops arrived in Harpers Ferry the following night. The next morning, Colonel Robert E. Lee ordered a squad of marines to storm the firehouse. In a matter of seconds, the marines killed two more of Brown’s men and captured the rest—including Brown.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ebf196d2fc9c4ec1a43868a592a245ea"> Brown was quickly convicted of treason, murder, and conspiracy. Some of his men received death sentences. John A. Copeland, a fugitive slave, defended his actions: “If I am dying for freedom, I could not die for a better cause.” Convinced that he also would be sentenced to death, Brown delivered a memorable speech.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ac6190a4fe334c8086eb75b5e59b2d53">As expected, the judge ordered Brown to be hanged. The sentence was carried out one month later on December 2, 1859.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4672d483ad4f47428007666627808e63">Many northerners mourned John Brown’s death, but some abolitionists criticized his extreme actions. Abraham Lincoln said Brown “agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong.” However, Lincoln continued, “That cannot excuse violence, bloodshed, and treason.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="b7df84b98d2d42dbb300b8b44ab897a0">Most southern whites—both slaveholders and non-slaveholders—felt threatened by the actions of John Brown. They worried that a “John Brown the Second” might attack. One South Carolina newspaper voiced these fears: “We are convinced the safety of the South lies only outside the present Union.” Another newspaper stated that “the sooner we get out of the Union, the better.”</p>
