        <p data-uuid="1e14737b1fa447dbb73b2bba8d2a483a">The Cold War began in Europe but quickly spread to the Asian nations of
            China and Korea. In China the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party had
            been struggling for control of the country since the early 1900s. The two
            rivals joined forces against Japan during World War II but then resumed their
            civil war after Japan’s defeat. The United States, as part of its commitment
            to stop the spread of communism, backed the Nationalists. The Nationalists
            were defeated, however, and were forced to flee to the island of Taiwan. Led
            by <dfn title="Zedong, Mao">Mao Zedong</dfn>, the Communists officially established the People’s
            Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Many Americans saw this as a disastrous
            failure of U.S. foreign policy. They feared that all of Asia might soon fall
            to communism.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c70d9076ea3f437596851a51b5cee28a">These fears were heightened by a crisis in Korea. Japan had controlled
            Korea from 1910 to the end of World War II. After the war, the Allies divided
            Korea at the <dfn title="38th parallel">38th parallel</dfn>. The Soviet Union controlled the northern
            part of Korea, and the United States occupied the south. Both sides set up
            governments, neither of which recognized the other as legitimate.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f12e3c13317e47a4b995ef1b7f90c178" class="">On
            June 25, 1950, North Korea’s Soviet-trained and equipped army stormed across
            the 38th parallel and invaded South Korea. The United Nations called for a
            cease-fire. But the North Koreans continued their attack.</p>
        <p data-uuid="710500ee1f7246c78927d9c70a8977b6">President
            Truman had to make an immediate decision: Should the United States use force
            to try to stop the North Korean invasion? On June 27 Truman announced: “I
            have ordered United States air and sea forces to give the [South] Korean
            government troops cover and support.” That same day, the UN decided to help
            South Korea “to repel the armed attack.” American general Douglas MacArthur
            was put in command of the UN forces, which included troops from the United
            States and 15 other countries. The majority of the troops were from the
            United States and South Korea.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e6d807dced6e40dc8ac445ad1b7acfa8">In
            the early battles in the Korean War, MacArthur’s forces were driven back to
            the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula, near the city of Pusan. Fierce
            fighting raged for six weeks before the UN troops turned the tide of the war
            with a surprise attack. Landing at the port city of Inchon on September 15,
            UN forces attacked the North Koreans from behind. About a month later,
            MacArthur’s troops captured Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital. They then
            advanced north to the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China.
            MacArthur told Truman he would “have the boys home by Christmas.”</p>

                military bases, where his father served in the U.S. Army. “It was here I
                learned to ride and shoot even before I could read or write,” he later said.
                After graduating first in his class at West Point, MacArthur began an army
                career that would last more than 50 years. He reached the rank of general in
                1918 and commanded troops in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.
                “When I joined the Army,” he told Congress in 1951, “it was the fulfillment of
                all my boyhood hopes and dreams.”</p>

            China suddenly sent hundreds of thousands of soldiers across the border to
            join the North Koreans. They drove UN forces south again, back below the 38th
            parallel. MacArthur suggested air strikes on Chinese cities and an attack on
            mainland China. Truman refused permission. He was determined to contain the
            war in Korea.</p>
        <p data-uuid="aba5879dc10c4883a24a0ef8f322f497">
            When MacArthur publicly criticized the
            president’s strategy, Truman relieved the general of command. “I fired General
            MacArthur because he wouldn’t respect the authority of the president,” Truman
            said. This was a very unpopular decision with the American public. MacArthur
            came home to a hero’s welcome.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c20c49b397f94ca6954396f90e6d3387">By
            the spring of 1951, the fighting in Korea settled into a violent stalemate.
            The UN forces had driven the North Koreans and Chinese back across the 38th
            parallel. But neither side seemed able to win the war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="12fe2b260a894258a98a88d613b2604f">Americans’
            frustration with the war dominated the 1952 presidential election. The
            Republicans nominated war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower. He promised to end the
            increasingly unpopular conflict, saying, “The first task of a new
            administration will be to . . . bring the Korean War to an early and
            honorable end.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="bd27d92fb25347e68f532854243e3590">
            This promise helped Eisenhower win the election.
            Eisenhower visited Korea, but the conflict dragged on. A cease-fire finally
            ended the fighting on July 27, 1953. After three years of fighting, North and
            South Korea were again divided near the 38th parallel. More than 130,000 Americans
            had been killed or wounded. Korean and Chinese casualties topped 2 million.</p>
