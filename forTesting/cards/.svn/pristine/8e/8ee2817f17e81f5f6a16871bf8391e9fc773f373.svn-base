            <h6 data-uuid="a6d39dd0ba7c45e381f0c174afd95e4d">Historical Context</h6>
            <p data-uuid="d40ce7fff3ac41b7ada482958a79afbc">From 1861 to 1865, the United States was divided by a bloody civil war. Both sides—the North and the South—entered the war with great confidence and mobilized forces quickly. Although most major battles were fought in the South, the war consumed the nation. In the end, the conflict resulted in freedom for some 4 million enslaved people and the preservation of the nation. The costs were staggering—more than 600,000 lives were lost and about $5 billion in property was damaged or destroyed.</p>

                the Civil War, both sides were convinced that they were in the right and
                represented the true spirit of democracy. Write an essay that explains why each
                side believed this and use specific examples from the documents as evidence.</p>
