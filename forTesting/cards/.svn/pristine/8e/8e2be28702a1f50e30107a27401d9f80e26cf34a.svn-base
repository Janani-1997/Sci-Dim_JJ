        <p data-uuid="d8d164e5f222435aa9aad54433c76fcf">John Adams had the challenging task of following Washington as president. The people had adored Washington. Adams would have to work hard to win the people’s trust.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="2a47473fd864432a814031ae5affaae4">A New President</h3>
        <p data-uuid="0409f1b7843c49cc8d3e06bf5da54d47"> At first glance, John Adams did not appear well suited for the presidency. Although Adams had been a leading Patriot during the American Revolution and had later served as a foreign diplomat, he lacked Washington’s dignity, and most people saw him as a cold and distant person. Still, many people—even those who opposed him—respected Adams. They recognized his hard work, honesty, and intelligence.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="770fc18480474442a7290ddf60ce2220">The United States and France</h3>
        <p data-uuid="4ae0fe1376854fc1b05619bfd2278916">One of Adams’s first goals as president was to improve the relationship between the United States and France. With Great Britain and France still at war, the French had begun harassing and seizing U.S. ships. Adams sent U.S. diplomats to Paris to smooth over the conflict and to negotiate a treaty to protect U.S. shipping.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7bf66b38b3054e159854ebb050dda1a2">When the diplomats arrived in France, they learned that French foreign minister Talleyrand would not speak to them. Instead, they had a strange and secret visit from three French agents. Shockingly, the agents said that Talleyrand would discuss a treaty only in exchange for a $250,000 bribe. The French government also wanted a loan of $12 million. The amazed diplomats refused these demands.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7838bccaa3244a598f3aa592662cfbca"> In March 1798 President Adams told Congress that the peace-seeking mission had failed. He described the French terms, substituting the letters X, Y, and Z for the names of the French agents. Upon hearing the disgraceful news, Federalists in Congress called for war with France.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="ef6aaf15947e48a781e1b125e0086154">Preparations for War</h3>
        <p data-uuid="036e2541ec1e411992174cea1ce494ae">Fearing war, Adams asked Congress to expand the navy to a fleet of more than 30 ships. He thought war with France might be unavoidable. He also decided the United States should keep a peacetime army. Congress approved both measures.</p>
        <p data-uuid="85af54e8e726432b8678fe313f729c53">Although Adams had asked Congress for military support, he did not want to go to war with France. He was worried about its cost. Therefore, he did not ask Congress to declare war. Instead, he tried to reopen peace talks with France.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="efe40767bae045ecaec0d594081bc227">Peace Efforts</h3>
        <p data-uuid="11ccdcc6c548443a849db5ed36c59a2b">Adams’s decision not to declare war stunned Federalists. Despite intense pressure from members of his own party, Adams refused to change his mind.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6357e0c4270548a5b0a717f382a199c4"> American and French ships, however, began fighting each other in the Caribbean. Adams sent a representative to France to engage in talks to try to end the fighting. The United States and France eventually signed a treaty. Adams then forced two members of his cabinet to resign for trying to block his peace efforts.<br />
