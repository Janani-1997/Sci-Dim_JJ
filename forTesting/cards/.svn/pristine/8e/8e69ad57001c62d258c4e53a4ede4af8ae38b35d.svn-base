        <p data-uuid="f7a78b1e109140a0aeb59ae7eeafb41a">Although Americans had declared war to secure Cuba’s independence, U.S. leaders began demanding that Spain also give up other colonies. As a result of the Spanish-American War, the peace treaty placed Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines under U.S. control. The United States was developing as a strong world political power. </p>
        <p data-uuid="ee9206bd188f414aa182f0153996064a"> In reaction, some Americans formed the <b><dfn title="Anti-Imperialist League">Anti-Imperialist League</dfn></b>. This group opposed the treaty and the creation of an American colonial empire. They argued that the treaty threatened democracy because it denied self-government to the people living in the newly acquired territories. The Senate approved the peace treaty by a vote of 57 to 27—just one vote more than the two-thirds majority needed to ratify treaties.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d8355cb3f0294d2887821ee5b5c404a9">The Teller Amendment had declared that the United States would not annex Cuba and it would have independence. However, McKinley wanted to create stability and increase U.S. economic activity there. He set up a military government—a government controlled by the U.S. military. He appointed Leonard Wood, who had commanded the Rough Riders during the war, as governor. Wood quickly began building schools and a sanitation system.</p>
        <p data-uuid="df1f9500e5324f62a0c044fa8409f7ad">Even with the new sanitation system, disease remained a major problem. Dr. Walter Reed, head of the army’s Yellow Fever Commission, was sent to Cuba in 1900 to help fight the disease. He and his volunteers conducted experiments, including allowing themselves to be bitten by infected insects. They soon proved that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes. Getting rid of the standing water where mosquitoes lived helped health officials to control the disease. </p>
        <p data-uuid="0be8edc74ad74f23839697dc00fd5dc0"> Governor Wood also oversaw the writing of a Cuban constitution. The document included the <b><dfn title="Platt Amendment">Platt Amendment</dfn></b>. This amendment limited Cuba’s right to make treaties and allowed the United States to intervene in Cuban affairs. It also required Cuba to sell or lease land to the United States. Cuban leaders compared the Platt Amendment to “handing over the keys to our house so that they [the Americans] can enter it at any time, whenever the desire seizes them.” The Cubans reluctantly accepted the amendment, and U.S. troops withdrew. The amendment remained in force until 1934. The U.S. government stayed actively involved in Cuban affairs until the late 1950s.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6580b2f68f78404caca2f8e1fbcdb84b">Like Cubans, Puerto Ricans had hoped for independence after the war. Instead, the U.S. government made the island an American territory. The United States set up a government and appointed top officials. Puerto Ricans were allowed little say in their own affairs. On April12, 1900, the Foraker Act established a civil government in Puerto Rico. It was headed by a governor and included a two-house legislature.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1f3c6c8d32c74e67b4f1ed49782fa453"> A debate over the new territory soon arose. People who lived in Puerto Rico were considered citizens of the island but not of the United States. In 1917 the Jones Act gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship and made Puerto Rico a self-governing territory. This act allowed Puerto Ricans to elect both houses of the legislature. However, another 30 years passed before Puerto Ricans could elect their own governor. Today, the island has its own constitution and elected officials. However, it remains associated with the United States as a commonwealth under U.S. control.<br />

        <p data-uuid="9499589fda4b47d58b9320bfc1127f39">Spain had surrendered the Philippines in return for a $20 million payment from the United States. Americans agreed with President McKinley, who said that the United States would benefit from the islands’ naval and commercial value. He also said that annexing the islands would keep Europeans from seizing them.</p>
        <p data-uuid="de2f4f7f3be64279b4d9ce1936d96cf8"> Filipino rebels, however, had expected to gain independence after the war. They had helped U.S. forces to capture Manila. When the United States decided instead to keep the islands, war broke out. Rebels led by Emilio Aguinaldo started a guerrilla war against the American forces. More than 4,200 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Filipinos died before the conflict ended in 1902.
