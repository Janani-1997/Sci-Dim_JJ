        <p data-uuid="059fcbb280024cd8866727aff8b75b14">Although diplomacy helped the United States resolve territorial disputes in the Pacific Northwest, diplomats working in the Southwest faced more challenges. Faced with an unstable and uncooperative Mexican government, the U.S. government found it necessary to become more aggressive in its diplomatic overtures. As a result, diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States became increasingly strained. U.S. involvement in California and Texas contributed to this tension.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="c532b2e135934287bab7454cf0b59497">Conflict Breaks Out</h3>
        <p data-uuid="092bfaa4740c4159a2af22d563ed18fc">Mexico had long insisted that its northern border in Texas lay along the Nueces River and refused to accept Texas annexation as legitimate. The United States said the border was farther south, along the Rio Grande. In June 1845 President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead an army into the disputed region.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5cad8763775b466daaf2c29a12a4c914">Polk sent diplomat John Slidell to Mexico City to try to settle the border dispute. Slidell came with an offer to buy New Mexico and California for $30 million. Mexican officials refused to speak to him.</p>
        <p data-uuid="15ff68bd703f4744b3259320918082b6"> In March 1846 General Taylor led his troops to the Rio Grande. He camped across from Mexican forces stationed near the town of Matamoros, Mexico. In April, the Mexican commander told Taylor to withdraw from Mexican territory. Taylor refused. The two sides clashed, and several U.S. soldiers were killed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="83b1fee35598464eb80b3faed97050a7">In response, President Polk said to Congress:</p>

        <p data-uuid="c9dc59525a3b475398cad32bf752c09f">At the beginning of the war with Mexico, the U.S. Army had better weapons and equipment. Yet it was greatly outnumbered and poorly prepared. The government put out a call for 50,000 volunteers. About 200,000 responded. Many were young men who thought the war would be a grand adventure in a foreign land.</p>

        <p data-uuid="0fffb4c54a5f4a0d8dd1ef730a28124b">On the home front, many Americans supported the war. However, many Whigs thought the war was unjustified and avoidable. Northern abolitionists also opposed the conflict. They feared the spread of slavery into southwestern lands.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ec95faef7c464e6fabb502b2272335bf"> While Americans debated the war, fighting proceeded. General Taylor’s soldiers won battles south of the Nueces River. Taylor then crossed the Rio Grande and occupied Matamoros, Mexico. While Taylor waited for more men, Polk ordered General Stephen Kearny to attack New Mexico. On August 18, 1846, Kearny took Santa Fe, the capital city, without a fight. He claimed the entire province of New Mexico for the United States and marched west to California, where another conflict with Mexico was already under way.</p>

        <p data-uuid="46bbe7991782424f8d16ae00ab959b8b">In 1846 only about 500 Americans lived in the huge province of California, in contrast to about 12,000 Californios. Yet, in the spirit of manifest destiny, a small group of American settlers seized the town of Sonoma, north of San Francisco, on June 14. Hostilities began between the two sides when the Americans took some horses that were intended for the Mexican militia. In what became known as the <dfn title="Bear Flag Revolt">Bear Flag Revolt</dfn>, the Americans declared California to be an independent nation.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4009f7b8e6a64dc89fffd25412ec388e"> Above the town, the rebels hoisted a hastily made flag of a grizzly bear facing a red star. Californios laughed at the roughly made bear, thinking it “looked more like a pig than a bear.”</p>

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="eac32a7e435147f4a881390e2a6dff8c">American settlers took over Sonoma, the regional headquarters of the Mexican general Mariano Vallejo, and declared California a new country: the California Republic.</p>

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="8547f726e0554272a7a5703d8356d45a">John C. Fr&#233;mont, a U.S. Army captain, was leading a mapping expedition across the Sierra Nevada when he heard of the possible war with Mexico. Fr&#233;mont went to Sonoma and quickly joined the American settlers in their revolt against the Californios. Because war had already broken out between the United States and Mexico, Fr&#233;mont’s actions were seen as beneficial to the American cause in the region. His stated goal, however, was Californian independence, not to annex California to the United States. During the revolt, several important Californios were taken prisoner, including Mariano Vallejo. Governor Vallejo and his brother were held at an Anglo settlement for two months without any formal charges being brought against them. Long after his release, Vallejo wrote a history of California that included an account of his time as a bear flag prisoner.</p>
        <p data-uuid="eea6537d2ef44fe8bd6e3c9480ca84c0"> But the bear flag was quick to fall. In July, naval forces from the United States—which never recognized Californian independence—came ashore in California and raised the stars and stripes. Kearny’s army arrived from the East. The towns of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco fell rapidly. In August, U.S. Navy commodore Robert Stockton claimed California for the United States. Some Californios continued to resist until early 1847, when they surrendered.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a30d79f7e0be4e4fb44cb96d63e11973">War’s End</h3>
        <p data-uuid="dcbad0b128e942849e70a542528ca094">In Mexico, General Taylor finally got the reinforcements he needed. Against orders, he drove his forces deep into enemy lands. Santa Anna, who had been removed from office and exiled the previous year, returned to power in Mexico in September 1846. He quickly came after Taylor with Mexican troops that outnumbered the Americans by three times.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5a7cc7f5dbec4a3c90e1a6bd862cf52f"> The two armies clashed at Buena Vista in February 1847. Taylor used his artillery to his advantage. After a close battle with heavy casualties on both sides, the Mexican army retreated. The next morning, the cry went up: “The enemy has fled! The field is ours!”</p>

He became known as “Old Rough and Ready” because of his enthusiasm to work side by side with his men. The general’s popularity troubled President Polk because the next presidential race was approaching. When Taylor’s progress stalled, Polk gave the command to General Winfield Scott. </p>

        <p data-uuid="d5405b995e134e9285aab1df221f9238">A beloved leader, Scott was known by his troops as “Old Fuss and Feathers” because of his strict military discipline. Scott sailed to the port of Veracruz, a major port and the site of the strongest fortress in Mexico. On March 29, after an 88-hour artillery attack, Veracruz fell. Scott moved on to the final goal, Mexico City, the capital. Taking a route similar to one followed by Spanish conquistador Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s in 1519, the Americans pushed 200 or so miles inland. Santa Anna tried to stop the U.S. forces at Cerro Gordo in mid-April, but failed. By August, 1847 U.S. troops were at the edge of Mexico City.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d7c1f753eb1e47dfb9dbba0ff5c0a0c0"> After a truce failed, Scott ordered a massive attack on Mexico City. Mexican soldiers and civilians fought fierce battles in and around the capital. At a military school atop the steep, fortified hill of Chapultepec, young Mexican cadets bravely defended their hopeless position. At least one soldier jumped to his death rather than surrender to the invading forces. Finally, on September 14, 1847, Mexico City fell. Santa Anna soon fled the country. Scott’s capture of the Mexican capital led to the end of the war.</p>
