            Congress debated Kennedy’s civil rights legislation. In November 1963 Kennedy
            began a quick tour of Texas cities.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ba823226ba2f4b73a9816ec9c303d609">On November 22, 1963, Kennedy rode through
            Dallas in a convertible, waving to supporters in the streets. Suddenly,
            gunshots rang out. Kennedy had been shot twice, and he died soon afterward in a
            Dallas hospital. Vice President <dfn title="Johnson, Lyndon B.">Lyndon
            B. Johnson</dfn> was quickly sworn in as president. Dallas police arrested an
            alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="920913db89f248c892837af643e3c864">The
            assassination stunned Americans, who grieved the young president’s death. Many
            of Kennedy’s goals were left unfinished. Vowing to continue Kennedy’s work,
            President Johnson urged Congress to pass a civil rights bill.</p>

                B. Johnson grew up in rural Texas. After working his way through college,
                Johnson taught school for a year. In 1937, at the age of 29, he was elected to
                the House of Representatives. He was elected to the Senate in 1948. Johnson was
                known for his ability to guide bills through Congress by convincing members
                from both political parties to support them. As one fellow member of Congress
                said, “Lyndon got me by the lapels [jacket collar] and put his face on top of
                mine and he talked and talked.” Johnson was elected vice president in 1960 and
                became president in 1963.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6413f8a2af614ac887f612dc7eb6ef6d">That summer, activists began to push for
            equal voting rights for African Americans in the South. Legally, of course,
            African Americans had the right to vote. But in much of the South, threats and
            unfair election rules often kept them from the polls. During the “Freedom
            Summer” of 1964, hundreds of volunteers, including many white college students,
            came to Mississippi. Their goal was to help African Americans register to vote.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7dd2328b41ae409bafea2cec02cbff4c">Volunteers were threatened and attacked. On
            June 21, three civil rights workers—James Chaney, a young black Mississippian
            plasterer’s apprentice; Andrew Goodman, a Jewish Queens College student; and
            Michael Schwerner, a Jewish social worker from New York City—were murdered by
            members of the Ku Klux Klan. Martin Luther King Jr. organized a voting rights
            march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, during which many marchers were
            beaten and jailed. Violence against civil rights workers convinced many people
            to support voter registration efforts.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f09f8bb99bf14c208e50a4e44226037f">
            Congress
            approved the <b><dfn title="Voting Rights Act of 1965">Voting Rights Act of
            1965</dfn></b>, which Johnson signed into law in August. This law gave the
            federal government new powers to protect African Americans’ voting rights.
            Within three years, more than half of all qualified African Americans in the
            South registered to vote.<br />
