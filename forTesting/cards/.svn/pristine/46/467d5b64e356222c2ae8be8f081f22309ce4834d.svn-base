        <p data-uuid="10c9b34c1a0b47c997d6fe937bd5e926">Around 1200 BC the Olmec developed the earliest-known civilization in Mesoamerica. The Olmec lived in the hot, humid areas along the southwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Their influence spread into other parts of Mexico and Central America through trade with other peoples.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3bca7385a3cf4962af4a9b3c5934ac04"> The Olmec are known for their use of stone in architecture and sculpture. They built the first pyramids in the Americas, and they created sculptures of huge stone heads. When their civilization ended around 400 BC, trade had spread Olmec culture throughout the region.</p>

These helmets are believed to be equipment used to play an ancient ballgame. Players of the game were usually important members of society. The game was played with a six-inch rubber ball that players could pass with their hips, legs, or elbows. A point was scored when the ball was passed into the opponent’s goal area. </p>

        <p data-uuid="19cbabc4e17c438791f0b7b63b761930">Like the Olmec, the Maya grew maize and other crops and lived in small villages. These villages traded goods with each other, and by about AD 200, the Maya were building large cities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="49ec88bb2922415dbdd8a47db9b76734"> Maya cities had pyramids, large stone temples, palaces, and bridges. The Maya also paved large plazas for public gatherings and built canals to control the flow of water through the cities.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f292eb5c87ee4d6eb1a37f19a8cb1a37">In the 900s Maya civilization began to collapse. Historians are still not sure what caused this great civilization’s decline. Theories include disease, soil exhaustion, and long-term drought, among others.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="7b9bd7d7953647dca5797a6b78aeaa2b">Aztec</h3>
        <p data-uuid="26b01a22dca4482ab3023080c9ce785c">The Aztec were fierce warriors, and their superior military ability was key to their success. Around the mid-1100s AD, the Aztec migrated south to Central Mexico. There they settled down, conquered many towns, made alliances to build their empire, and controlled a huge trade network.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9b545a68783b4ceabce6f861884fc1af"> In AD 1325 the Aztec founded their capital, Tenochtitl&#225;n (tay-nawch-teet-LAHN), on an island in Lake Texcoco. Raised roads called causeways connected the island to the shore, making trade and travel easier. Tenochtitl&#225;n became the greatest city in the Americas and one of the world’s largest cities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ceb8c5555e9f4735a6b99ae21d6f2481">Trade and tribute paid by conquered people in the form of cotton, gold, and food made the Aztec rich. By the early 1500s, they ruled the most powerful state in Mesoamerica.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b20622db1ba0479b8d669f41d4b98138">The Aztec used mathematics and their observations of the heavens to create a calendar. The calendar was made up of two cycles that together formed a 52-year period. Among other Aztec achievements were jade and stone carvings, the use of medicinal herbs, and maintenance of a road system. They also had a writing system made up of signs and symbols. The Aztec spoke Nahuatl, a language that still has some 1.5 million speakers, most of whom live in Central Mexico.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4ccf1da1d7294a798eff86b89aeffa84">The Inca began as a small tribe in the Andes Mountains of South America. They named their capital city Cuzco (koo-skoh). In the mid-1400s, the Inca began to expand their territory. By the 1500s the empire stretched along the Pacific coast from what is now northern Ecuador to central Chile. In time, the empire was home to about 12 million people. The Inca formed a strong central government with a king as ruler. The official language of the empire was Quechua.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d176ec71709b4c3dbb910fa7a7ec456b">Because they had no written language, the Inca kept records with a system of knotted strings called <i>quipu</i>. They also used <i>quipu </i>for mathematics. The knots and their positions on the string indicated numbers, while the strings’ colors represented what was being counted. For example, red strings may have been used to count warriors or yellow strings to count gold.</p>
        <p data-uuid="871a3203a7074bb4915bec5295b09bcf">The Inca were known for building and for art. Massive buildings and forts were made of huge stone blocks. An advanced system of highways ran the length of the empire. Paved roads and rope bridges connected all parts of Inca territory. This enabled the Inca to communicate with and control their large empire.</p>
