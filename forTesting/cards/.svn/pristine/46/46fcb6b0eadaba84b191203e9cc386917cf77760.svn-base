            Great
            Britain had won the French and Indian War, but Parliament still had to pay for
            it. The British continued to keep a standing, or permanent, army in North
            America to protect the colonists against Indian attacks. To help pay for this
            army, Prime Minister George Grenville asked Parliament to tax the colonists. In
            1764 Parliament passed the Sugar Act, which set duties on molasses and sugar
            imported by colonists. This was the first act passed specifically to raise
            money in the colonies.<br />

        <p data-uuid="b1fffaefdb3a49fc8d73f72cf3b49f72">British officials
            also tried harder to arrest smugglers. Colonial merchants were required to list
            all the trade goods they carried aboard their ships. These lists had to be
            approved before ships could leave colonial ports. This made it difficult for
            traders to avoid paying duties. The British navy also began to stop and search
            ships for smuggled goods.</p>
        <p data-uuid="becd630034694a7e9888296fb3cb171d">Parliament also
            changed the colonies’ legal system by giving greater powers to the
            vice-admiralty courts. These courts had no juries, and the judges treated
            suspected smugglers as guilty until proven innocent. In regular British courts,
            accused persons were treated as innocent until proven guilty.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6ce59ce1802545408401793975b46e91">Parliament’s actions
            upset many colonists who had grown used to being independent and governing
            themselves. The Parliament’s longtime practice of salutary neglect, or not
            enforcing most laws governing the colonies, had fostered individualism among
            the colonists. The government’s previous hands-off approach made these actions
            seem even harsher to the colonists. The rising merchant class thought the taxes
            were unfair and hurt business. Many believed that Great Britain had no right to
            tax the colonies at all without popular consent. </p>
        <p data-uuid="e5ac07b35e0c4bad81a2b45ec1b513e8">James Otis, a
            colonial lawyer, argued that the power of the Crown and Parliament was limited.
            Otis said they could not “take from any man any part of his property, without
            his consent in person or by representation.” Colonial assemblies had little
            influence on Parliament’s decisions. In addition, the colonists had no direct
            representatives in Parliament. The colonists were subjects of the Crown instead
            of citizens of England.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0d8a78d4c71045eda1a33131f12d2290">
            At a
            Boston town meeting in May 1764, local leader <b><dfn title="Adams, Samuel">Samuel Adams</dfn></b> agreed with Otis. He believed that Parliament
            could not tax the colonists without their permission. The ideas of Otis and
            Adams were summed up in the slogan “No Taxation without Representation,” which
            spread throughout the colonies.<br />

            <p data-uuid="b3f3aff918e049298d82b7d04930bc2d">Thomas Jefferson called Samuel Adams “truly the Man of
                the revolution.” Adams led the call for opposition to Great Britain in the
                years leading up to the American Revolution. </p>
            <p data-uuid="ba50fe3bee934678a887589e8ac64dc5">Samuel Adams had always been fascinated with politics.
                After holding a variety of jobs, including that of a tax collector, Adams
                became a political leader in Massachusetts. He held many offices in the Massachusetts
                legislature, and was a bold opponent of Great Britain’s Sugar Act in 1764.</p>
            <p data-uuid="b708276d56a743b5b8d2ed6d8718beaa">Adams is recognized as one of the first supporters of
                independence from Great Britain. He desired to live in a country free from the
                rule of the British government. He believed that the colonists had the right to
                rule themselves. Samuel Adams spoke forcefully against the oppressive laws of
                the British Parliament, including the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts.</p>
            <p data-uuid="0323796e3c8a476fb7e95312ffcc21b0">Adams believed many other colonists felt the same way
                he did. He also realized that in order to be heard, the colonists needed to
                unite in protest against Great Britain. In 1772 he helped create the Committees
                of Correspondence. These committees allowed ideas to be shared and spread across
                the thirteen colonies. Colonists began to realize that they could unite through
                these ideas. They started to see Adams’s vision of a united force against the British.</p>
            <p data-uuid="80af92f329e24399a250e66b0bc96f77">A leading figure behind the revolutionary movement, Adams
                helped to organize the Sons of Liberty in 1765. The Sons of Liberty took part
                in open defiance of British laws. Adams also encouraged a boycott of British
                goods. His daring spirit was demonstrated in several historic events, among
                them his demand that British soldiers be removed from Boston following the Boston Massacre and his
                organization of the Boston Tea Party. Samuel Adams’s revolutionary spirit
                fueled the movement against Great Britain.</p>

                Samuel
                Adams went on to serve in the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1781, sign the Declaration
                of Independence, and serve as governor of Massachusetts. Above all, his
                determination led the colonies to freedom.</p>

        <p data-uuid="aa35c42588a447d9bc2bbe4f166ee7e2">A popular method of
            protest was the boycott, in which people refused to buy British goods. The
            first colonial boycott started in New York in 1765. It soon spread to other
            colonies. Colonists hoped that their efforts would hurt the British economy and
            might convince Parliament to end the new taxes.</p>

            The
            British government continued to search for new ways to tax the American
            colonies, further angering many colonists. For example, Prime Minister Grenville
            proposed the <b><dfn title="Stamp Act of 1765">Stamp Act of 1765</dfn></b>.
            This act required colonists to pay for an official stamp, or seal, when they
            bought paper items. The tax had to be paid on legal documents, licenses,
            newspapers, pamphlets, and even playing cards. Colonists who refused to buy
            stamps could be fined or sent to jail.<br />

        <p data-uuid="a364c54eee5946dcabd4109f5c6c9a10">Grenville did not
            expect this tax to spark protest. After all, in Britain people already paid similar
            taxes. But colonists saw it differently. The Stamp Act was Parliament’s first
            attempt to raise money by taxing the colonists directly, rather than by taxing
            imported goods. <dfn title="Warren, Mercy Otis">Mercy Otis Warren</dfn>, a writer in the Massachusetts colony,
            disagreed with the new tax. She began writing plays that were sharply critical of the British government's actions. </p>
        <p data-uuid="d524eb16e4a449ccb757e99c18148e7e">Protests against the
            Stamp Act began almost immediately. Colonists formed a secret society called
            the Sons of Liberty. Samuel Adams helped organize the group in Boston. This group
            sometimes used violence to frighten tax collectors. Many colonial courts shut
            down because people refused to buy the stamps required for legal documents.
            Businesses openly ignored the law by refusing to buy stamps.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dca3269b7e0b4d2c96f20089639ea613">
            In May
            1765 a Virginia lawyer named Patrick Henry presented a series of resolutions to
            the Virginia House of Burgesses. These resolutions stated that the Stamp Act
            violated colonists’ rights. In addition to taxation without representation, the
            Stamp Act denied the accused a trial by jury. Henry’s speech in support of the
            resolutions convinced the assembly to support some of his ideas.<br />

        <p data-uuid="11604459c5f3441aa56218e6c455c51a">In Boston the members
            of the Massachusetts legislature called for a Stamp Act Congress. In October
            1765 delegates from nine colonies met in New York. They issued a declaration
            that the Stamp Act was a violation of their rights and liberties.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5fbe9284311845378dfff5199a79b1d5">Pressure on
            Parliament to repeal, or do away with, the Stamp Act grew quickly. A group of
            London merchants complained that their trade suffered from the colonial
            boycott. Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a042c7551cb44a4fa92f424cbaed2ed4">Members of Parliament
            were upset that colonists had challenged their authority. Thus, Parliament issued
            the Declaratory Act, which stated that Parliament had the power to make laws
            for the colonies “in all cases whatsoever.” The Declaratory Act further worried
            the colonists. The act stripped away much of their independence. </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="207b4b2e0c7c4f0299b32894248b0b9c">Townshend Acts</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b0207327a26d4c6a9cc7ca46a1dde82f">In June 1767
            Parliament passed the Townshend Acts. These acts placed duties on glass, lead,
            paint, paper, and tea. To enforce the Townshend Acts, British officials used
            writs of assistance. These allowed tax collectors to search for smuggled goods.
            Colonists hated the new laws because they took power away from colonial
            governments.</p>
        <p data-uuid="356b43b1cd7940b2ab5c1c817c31725b">The colonists
            responded to the Townshend Acts by once again boycotting many British goods.
            Women calling themselves the Daughters of Liberty supported the boycott. In
            February 1768 Samuel Adams wrote a letter arguing that the laws violated the
            legal rights of the colonists. The Massachusetts legislature sent the letter to
            other colonies’ legislatures, who voted to join the protest.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a4a84a360fa74f2da4e57fb2d679e39b">
            At the
            same time, tax collectors in Massachusetts seized the ship <i>Liberty</i> on suspicion
            of smuggling. This action angered the ship’s owner and the Sons of Liberty.
            They attacked the houses of customs officials in protest. In response, the
            governor broke up the Massachusetts legislature. He also&#160;asked troops to restore
            order. British soldiers arrived in Boston in October 1768.</p>
