        <p data-uuid="05251f91e44b458fa84b88cae763d938">Some Progressives worked to reduce the power of political machines in state and local governments. In many places, reformers replaced corrupt ballots that listed only one party’s candidates with ballots prepared by the government that listed all candidates. Under pressure from reformers, many states adopted secret ballots. This ensured privacy for every voter.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c6287739f4ff44edbc82ed46877c73c0">Progressives thought officials would be more responsive to voters if voters were directly involved in government. To help make this happen, reformers worked to expand voting power. For example, they favored the <b><dfn title="Seventeenth Amendment">Seventeenth Amendment</dfn></b>, which allowed Americans to vote directly for U.S. senators. Before the constitutional amendment was passed in 1913, state legislatures had elected senators. </p>
        <p data-uuid="7145b1527dba42f7875e7d975e52b702">Reformers also favored the direct primary, an election in which voters choose candidates to run for public office directly. In 1903 Wisconsin became the first state to have a direct primary. Previously, party leaders had selected which candidates would run for office.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f17bbe738b8440bdbc727e5fe603eaa0"> Other reform measures allowed voters to take action against corrupt politicians. Some states and cities gave unhappy voters the right to sign a petition asking for a special vote. The purpose of that vote was to <b><dfn title="recall">recall</dfn></b>, or remove, an official before the end of his or her term. If enough voters signed the petition, the vote took place. The official could then be removed from office if there was a majority of recall votes.</p>

        <p data-uuid="96cf7c2418984def9df9731c46f0c466">In California, Oregon, and states in the Midwest, Progressives worked on reforms to give voters direct influence over new laws. A procedure called the <b><dfn title="initiative">initiative</dfn></b> allowed voters to propose a new law by collecting signatures on a petition. If enough signatures were collected, the proposed law was voted on at the next election. Another measure was called the <b><dfn title="referendum">referendum</dfn></b>. It permitted voters to approve or reject a law that had already been proposed or passed by a government body. This process gave voters a chance to overrule laws that they opposed.</p>

        <p data-uuid="35a0c3f723a74868a70fa428ce3390c5">Progressives also tried to change the way city government operated. Some reformers wanted city government to be run like a business. As a result of their efforts, several cities changed to council-manager governments. Under this system, voters elect a city council. The council then appoints a professional manager to run the city. Other business-minded reformers supported the commission form of government. Under this system, the city is headed by a group of elected officials. Each official manages a major city agency, such as housing or transportation.</p>

            <p data-uuid="85cad923f81c4ac8ad325f548f19b4f5">Born in rural Wisconsin in 1855, Robert M. La Follette began his political career at a young age. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, becoming the youngest member of Congress. He soon earned the nickname “Fighting Bob” for his energetic speaking style and his active support for progressive reforms.</p>
            <p data-uuid="b0090cfb695d462380c196d9ed8e65d0"> After serving as Wisconsin’s governor and as U.S. senator, La Follette ran for president as the Progressive Party candidate in 1924. He won his home state and received about 16 percent of the popular vote.</p>

        <p data-uuid="dd35cbb30d2a45e7964be2b32f54c0e9">La Follette decreased the power of political machines. He used university professors and other experts to help write new laws and work in state agencies. He also made information on how politicians voted available to the public. That way, voters would know if leaders had kept their campaign promises. Called the Wisconsin Idea, La Follette’s plan became a model for progressive reforms in other states.</p>
