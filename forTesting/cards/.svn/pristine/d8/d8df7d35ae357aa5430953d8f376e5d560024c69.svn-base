        <p data-uuid="6793c653b3f041f6afc9fe4814dab347">Hitler dreamed of avenging Germany’s defeat in World War I. “The lost land will never be won back by solemn appeals to God,” he told Germans, “nor by hopes in any League of Nations, but only by force of arms.” Hitler wanted to build an empire, uniting all German-speaking people in Europe. He also wanted “living space” for the growing German population. </p>
        <p data-uuid="db14d2493ead47ecaa39ddfe665345e0"> In violation of the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler began to rebuild the German military. In 1936 Nazi troops invaded the Rhineland, a former German territory lost during World War I. That year he also signed an alliance with Mussolini, forming the <b><dfn title="Axis Powers">Axis Powers</dfn></b>. Japan later joined this pact. In 1938 Hitler forced Austria to unite with Germany. Then he demanded control of the Sudetenland, a region in Czechoslovakia where many Germans lived. When the Czechs refused, Hitler threatened war.<br />

        <p data-uuid="e3f2bbff8542495e97daf2165bcbd4af">Czech leaders looked to their allies in France and Great Britain for help. But neither country wanted to be pulled into an armed conflict. British prime minister Neville Chamberlain organized a meeting with Hitler to work out a peaceful solution. At the 1938 Munich Conference, Germany was given control over the Sudetenland in return for a promise not to demand more land. This approach was known as <b><dfn title="appeasement">appeasement</dfn></b>—a policy of avoiding war with an aggressive nation by giving in to its demands. British admiral <b><dfn title="Churchill, Winston">Winston Churchill</dfn></b> was convinced that this strategy would not stop Hitler. “The government had to choose between shame and war,” Churchill warned. “They have chosen shame. They will get war.”<br />

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="9353068dca364f97918e38e053525a13">Churchill was right. In March 1939 German troops seized the rest of Czechoslovakia and began demanding territory from Poland. Great Britain and France pledged to defend Poland if Hitler attacked. To keep the Soviets out of the conflict, Hitler signed a nonaggression pact with Joseph Stalin in August 1939. In addition to promising not to attack each other, the two countries secretly agreed to divide Poland between them. </p>
        <p data-uuid="3d04079d405440dea868839238cb15a3"> On September 1, 1939, Hitler’s troops and tanks rushed into Poland. This was the start of World War II. Two days later, Britain and France, known as the <b><dfn title="Allied powers">Allied Powers</dfn></b>, declared war on Germany. Neville Chamberlain spoke bitterly of the failure of appeasement, saying, “Everything that I believed in during my public life has crashed into ruins.”<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a92611c1b136440891c199b365411304">Hitler Moves West</h3>
        <p data-uuid="7d257b12d77a4013850049317ce5fdb5">The Allied Powers had little time to organize their forces to protect Poland. Using a strategy called <i>blitzkrieg</i>, or “lightning war,” German tanks and airplanes broke through Polish defenses. As German forces drove into Poland from the west, the Soviets attacked from the east. Within a month, the two powers had taken control of Poland. </p>
        <p data-uuid="74728b99b1294eeea572f04eac993e3a">With Poland secure, Hitler turned toward western Europe. In the spring of 1940, Germany quickly conquered the countries of Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. German troops then invaded France, trapping hundreds of thousands of Belgian, British, and French soldiers in the French port city of Dunkirk. British ships and boats of all kinds raced to Dunkirk and carried the soldiers across the English Channel to safety in Britain. </p>
        <p data-uuid="bcb6b8b97e32440e9652b67005635a16"> German forces, meanwhile, continued their march through France. As the Germans approached the French capital of Paris, Italy declared war on the Allied Powers. France surrendered to Germany on June 22, 1940. Many of the French soldiers who had escaped at Dunkirk, however, continued to resist Germany’s occupation of France. In London, French general Charles de Gaulle organized a “Free French” army to fight alongside the Allies. “France has lost a battle,” de Gaulle declared, “but France has not lost the war!”<br />

        <p data-uuid="d1634f36dc15432da8f285c9b8ae6f17">Britain now stood alone against Hitler’s war machine. “The final German victory over England is now only a question of time,” said German general Alfred Jodl. Hitler prepared to invade Britain. To move troops and equipment across the English Channel, Germany first had to defeat the British Royal Air Force (RAF). In July 1940 the Luftwaffe, or German air force, began attacking British planes and airfields in what became known as the Battle of Britain.<br />
