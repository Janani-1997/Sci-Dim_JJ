        <p data-uuid="fe083755d49444f9a243aec1124b2ee0">During the 1790s and early 1800s, some Americans felt there was a strong need for religious reform and took part in a Christian renewal movement called the <b><dfn title="Second Great Awakening">Second Great Awakening</dfn></b>. It swept through towns across upstate New York and through the frontier regions of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and South Carolina. By the 1820s and 1830s, this new interest in religion had spread to New England and the South.</p>
        <p data-uuid="87893d2856cb45a59a381fcf4c5325e0"><b><dfn title="Finney, Charles Grandison">Charles Grandison Finney</dfn></b> was one of the most important leaders of the Second Great Awakening. After experiencing a dramatic religious conversion in 1821, Finney left his career as a lawyer and began preaching. He challenged some traditional Protestant beliefs, telling congregations that each individual was responsible for his or her own salvation. He also believed that sin was avoidable. Finney held revivals, emotional prayer meetings that lasted for days. Many people converted to Christianity during these revivals. Finney told new converts to prove their faith by doing good deeds.<br />

        <p data-uuid="d349e948974e4435ac1cddd3a8eae9e6">Finney’s style of preaching and his ideas angered some traditional ministers, like Boston’s <b><dfn title="Beecher, Lyman">Lyman Beecher</dfn></b>. Beecher wanted to prevent Finney from holding revivals in his city. Despite the opposition of Beecher and other traditional ministers, Finney’s appeal remained powerful. Also, the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion prevented the government from passing laws banning the new religious practices. Ministers were therefore free to spread their message of faith and salvation to whoever wished to listen.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b89f7ae025564576a811835ac3d5b623">Due to the efforts of Finney and his followers, church membership across the country grew a great deal during the Second Great Awakening. Many new church members were women and African Americans. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was formed and spread across the Middle Atlantic states. Although the movement had begun in the Northeast and on the frontier, the Second Great Awakening renewed some people’s religious faith throughout America.<br />
