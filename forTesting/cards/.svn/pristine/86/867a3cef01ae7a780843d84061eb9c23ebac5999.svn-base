        <p data-uuid="dc5a059f025846949c1719ace54cfeb3">Like Ghana, Mali lay along the upper Niger River. This area’s fertile soil helped Mali grow. In addition, Mali’s location on the Niger allowed its people to control trade on the river. Through this control of trade, the empire grew rich and powerful. According to legend, Mali’s rise to power began under a ruler named Sundiata. Sundiata won back his country’s independence and conquered nearby kingdoms, including Ghana.</p>
        <p data-uuid="93468d16ea3545a582f72a3ff2173e92"> Mali’s most famous ruler, however, was a Muslim king named <b><dfn title="Mansa Musa">Mansa Musa</dfn></b> (MAHN-sah moo-SAH). Under his leadership, Mali reached the height of its wealth, power, and fame.</p>

            <p data-uuid="2a47bbc0dc264494a8f728dfa7ece0c2">Mansa Musa was a descendant of Sundiata, the first emperor to rule a united Mali. Mansa Musa became emperor in 1312 and earned a reputation as an able administrator. He increased the territory of Mali and was a patron of education and the arts.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5b69d50df56540a28fc2e6c973a94319">Mansa Musa ruled Mali from about 1312 to 1337. During that time, Mali added many important trade cities, including Timbuktu (tim-buhk-TOO), Djenn&#233; (je-NAY), and Gao (GOW), to its empire. Traders came to Timbuktu from the north and the south to trade for salt, gold, metals, shells, and many other goods.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="8aedad8fec6b469b87b8a2e4fce5401d"> Religion was also very important to Mansa Musa. In 1324 he left Mali on a <b><dfn title="hajj">hajj</dfn></b>, or pilgrimage to Mecca. Making this journey once in their lives is the spiritual duty of all Muslims. As he traveled to Mecca, Mansa Musa introduced his empire to the world. The stories of Mali’s wealth and religion spread far and wide. Because of Mansa Musa’s influence, Islam spread through a large part of West Africa.</p>

        <p data-uuid="171c60b8bebd44fbbe4a58c3b86d65c1">Mansa Musa wanted all Muslims to be able to read the Qur’an. Therefore, he stressed the importance of learning to read and write the Arabic language. He sent scholars to study in Morocco. These scholars later set up schools in Mali for studying the Qur’an.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="4a5466007fc64c8584315e7f3390ec50">To encourage the spread of Islam in West Africa, Mansa Musa brought back artists and architects from other Muslim countries to build <b><dfn title="mosques">mosques</dfn></b>, or buildings for Muslim prayer, throughout his lands.</p>
        <p data-uuid="402bbf2a9d324ecd91ab3775fd6f38fd"> The architectural advances in cities like Timbuktu as well as an organized government, an emphasis on education, and an expansion of trade all combined to make Mansa Musa Mali’s most successful ruler. Much of Mali’s success depended on strong leaders. After Mansa Musa died, poor leadership weakened the empire. By 1500 nearly all of the lands the kingdom once ruled were lost. Only a small area of Mali remained.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c2a50cbb5f2f4372bd7370413604fdd7">In the 1300s Mansa Musa had conquered a rival kingdom of people called the Songhai, who also lived along the Niger River. As the Mali Empire weakened in the 1400s, the Songhai grew wealthy by trading goods along the Niger. They took advantage of Mali’s decline, regained their independence, and eventually conquered most of Mali.</p>
        <p data-uuid="937a27cf4f0747c1be86e9c989e7675f"> One of Songhai’s greatest rulers was Muhammad Ture, who chose the title <i>askia</i>, a title of military rank. He became known as <b><dfn title="Askia the Great">Askia the Great</dfn></b>.</p>

            <p data-uuid="e14d40c3f7b94b8b9706d762b70bf509">Askia the Great became ruler of Songhai when he was nearly 50 years old. While his father, Sunni Ali, was a great warrior, Askia was a great statesman. He ruled Songhai for about 35 years. He organized and added to the lands that Sunni Ali had conquered. Under his leadership, Songhai became a well-run empire and a center of trade and learning. </p>
            <p data-uuid="994f523df91440e9a3123d68f8737da1"> By 1519 Askia was a half-blind old man. His son Musa forced him from the throne and banished him to live on an island in the Niger River. He lived there for nine years until another of his sons brought him back to Gao, where he died a year later. His tomb is still one of the most honored places in all of West Africa.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d5593be3e6834dc599c162a397ad1f53">Like Mansa Musa, Askia the Great was a devout Muslim who supported education and learning. Under his rule, the cities of Gao and Timbuktu flourished. They contained great mosques, universities, schools, and libraries. People came from all parts of West Africa to study mathematics, science, medicine, grammar, and law. Djenn&#233; also prospered, becoming the empire’s most important center of trade.</p>

        <p data-uuid="699fc1dbcf9249e8b75a8fd1d74708e9">Askia understood that an empire needed effective government. He created a professional army, and to improve the government, he set up five provinces within Songhai. He removed local leaders and appointed new governors who were loyal to him. He also created specialized departments to oversee various tasks, much like modern-day government offices do.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8f1b525ffbb9407fbf2d43f0f4ef092c"> Soon after Askia the Great lost power, the empire of Songhai declined. Songhai was invaded by the Moroccans, the kingdom’s northern neighbors. The Moroccans wanted to control the Saharan salt mines. They had superior military power and were able to take over Timbuktu and Gao. Changes in trade patterns completed Songhai’s fall.</p>
