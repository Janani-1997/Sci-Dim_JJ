They saw him as an honest leader and a hero of the Revolution. Many believed he should be the first U.S. president. Washington had been looking forward to retirement and a quiet life on his Virginia farm. When he hesitated at becoming a candidate for the presidency, his friends convinced him to run. Fellow politician Gouverneur Morris told him,&#160;“As

            <p data-uuid="8072f8488d99446d89dc8c8b63e339f0">Born in Virginia, Martha Dandridge was the eldest of eight siblings. At 18, she married Daniel Park Custis, a wealthy planter. They had four children, but two died in infancy. After a brief illness, Custis died in 1757.</p>
            <p data-uuid="90a4cf39b2e6445c973afe721d988ad3">Martha later met a Virginia Militia colonel named George Washington. They married in 1759. Between 1775 and 1780, Martha Washington often accompanied her husband to battlegrounds during the Revolutionary War. She joined him at his headquarters and camps, spending winters at Valley Forge and Morristown, New Jersey.</p>
            <p data-uuid="be18a70462b14db180411ed054a6cb33">Martha Washington became America’s first First Lady when George was elected president. The family moved to New York, where Martha Washington ran the household and hosted formal dinners and receptions. Called “Lady Washington,” Martha held the position with dignity and grace, but she did not enjoy it. She wrote that she felt like a “state prisoner.” But she worked hard, and visiting dignitaries were impressed with the elegance of the presidential household.</p>
            <p data-uuid="524068dcae5b4f7791653245e420e0e5"> After serving a second term, the Washingtons moved back to Mount Vernon, George’s home in Virginia. George Washington died in 1799; Martha in 1802. Before she died, she freed the slaves on the family plantation and burned the letters that she and her husband had written each other.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6a202a31ec2f4060b15f41a74aef1d62">Other women of the time period, such as author Judith Sargent Murray, believed that women needed to play a greater role in the new nation than Martha Washington did. Murray, Abigail Adams, and others believed in Republican Motherhood, the idea that women played an important role in teaching their children to be good citizens.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d993ea6a7c8c43bb9e5fcb585b9640d6">Some promoters of Republican Motherhood did not expect women to participate in politics or business. Other people, however, hoped that Republican Motherhood would lead to greater opportunities for women. They hoped more women would receive an education. Only a few families were willing to provide much education for their daughters, and adult women rarely had the time or money to get an education later in life. Most women in the early republic faced long days managing their households and working hard inside or outside the home to support their families.<br />
