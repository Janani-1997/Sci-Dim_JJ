            that the United States was waging a War on Terror. The <b><dfn title="Department of Homeland Security">Department of
            Homeland Security</dfn></b> was established in 2002 to manage the actions.
            The department was to analyze threats; guard the nation’s borders, seaports,

        <p data-uuid="0719b00805d54416aa52861b5565cb15">Responding to 9/11, Congress quickly passed the <b><dfn title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</dfn></b> in late 2001 to give the
            government power to search and conduct electronic surveillance of suspected
            terrorists. This law gave the government expanded powers to protect the nation.

            Act is constitutional. Critics complained that it gave law enforcement too much
            power and posed a threat to basic American freedoms. To address these
            complaints, Congress let some provisions of the law expire after a set period
            of time. Since then, some of the provisions have been extended for security
            purposes.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8b1af09a8cc5482790ae4878b1896bb8">In response to 9/11, many states have also passed
            legislation specifying how and when the government can use electronic
            surveillance to monitor people. The debate over the constitutionality of many
            of these laws continues.

        <p data-uuid="15f1a6b5bd5e4142a455a139716fe3fb">The war in Iraq caused fierce debate at home. After
            months of searching, no weapons of mass destruction were uncovered. No concrete
            ties between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda could be proven either. Critics began
            to accuse the Bush administration of exaggerating the danger that Saddam posed
            to the United States. The continuing violence between Iraqi insurgents and U.S.
            soldiers led many Americans to call for an end to the war. Meanwhile, growing
            concerns that Iraq’s neighbor, Iran, was working to develop nuclear weapons
            caused additional tensions in the region.</p>

            election. Afterwards, Secretary of State Colin Powell resigned. Bush appointed <b><dfn title="Rice, Condoleeza">Condoleezza Rice</dfn></b> as his replacement. She
            became the first African American woman to hold the office. Bush’s other new
            cabinet appointees included Alberto Gonzales, the first Hispanic attorney
            general.</p>

            justices, John Roberts and Samuel Alito. The Senate investigated each
            thoroughly before approving them. With the confirmation of Bush’s nominees, the
            Court began making more conservative rulings.</p>
        <p data-uuid="204e39b2a2d145d6badf3ea184cd0fb4">Due to public discontent with his policies in
            the Middle East, President Bush lost much of his support among voters.
            Democrats gained a majority in both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterm
            elections. The new Congress elected <b><dfn title="Pelosi, Nancy">Nancy Pelosi</dfn></b> the
            first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. In response to the
            outcome of the election, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld resigned and a
            new secretary, Robert Gates, was appointed. The newly elected Congress began
            calling for a plan to withdraw from Iraq.</p>

            response to the natural disasters of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Hurricane
            Katrina flooded many parts of the Gulf Coast and the city of New Orleans.
            Local, state, and federal governments were criticized for their inadequate
            response to the crisis. The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
            (FEMA) stepped down amid criticism. As victims tried to rebuild their towns and
            cities, Hurricane Rita struck a second blow to the region. The combined effects
            of the two storms caused many residents to permanently leave the Gulf Coast
            area.</p>

            fall of 2008, causing an economic recession. At this point, more than
            two-thirds of Americans disapproved of Bush administration policies.</p>
