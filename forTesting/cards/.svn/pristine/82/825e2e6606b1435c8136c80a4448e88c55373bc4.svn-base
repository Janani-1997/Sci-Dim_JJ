        <p data-uuid="4591b35ba99043708559bc5ac9922edc">Allied victories at Midway and Guadalcanal helped change the course of the war in the Pacific. The Allies now saw their chance to go on the offensive, with the goal of reaching Japan itself.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="bc154bac1fc14e39a1010f0223374dd0">Island Hopping</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d4230ef450c84a0c82bc3437b2c4ab64">To fight their way toward Japan, Allied war planners developed a strategy called <b><dfn title="island-hopping">island hopping</dfn></b>, where Allied forces took only the most strategically important islands, instead of each Japanese-held island. They could use each captured island as a base for the next attack, while isolating the Japanese forces on the bypassed islands. </p>
        <p data-uuid="64adb0dd5ede49f4a45aaa85142c8ab8">Island hopping proved to be a successful strategy, though very costly to execute. Japanese forces fortified key islands and fought fiercely to hold on to them. In November 1943, U.S. Marines leapt off their boats and waded toward Tarawa, one of the Gilbert Islands. They advanced into ferocious fire from Japanese machine guns. “The water seemed never clear of . . . men,” one marine said. “They kept falling, falling, falling.” Both sides sustained heavy casualties at Tarawa, but the marines captured the island. The Allies won similar victories in the Marshall, Mariana, Volcano, and Bonin islands. </p>
        <p data-uuid="0c327c6c29b841109992b6d8fc75cbf7">In October 1944 General MacArthur led a mission to retake the Philippines. The Japanese navy confronted the Allies at the <b><dfn title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</dfn></b>, the largest naval battle in history. The Allies crushed the Japanese fleet, crippling Japan’s naval power for the remainder of the war. It also gave the Allies a base from which to attack the main shipping routes that supplied Japan. After splashing ashore on Leyte, MacArthur proudly declared: “People of the Philippines: I have returned.” Securing the Philippines took many more months of fighting. Allied forces and Filipino guerrillas finally drove out or captured all of the Japanese defenders by the summer of 1945.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3cb7da151d1e48a7a95f26a1721b0d76">With key islands close to Japan secured, Allied planes began bombing targets in Japan in November 1944. A recently developed airplane, the B-29, played a major role in the effort. These planes, which could carry 20,000 pounds of explosives each, led bombing raids on more than 60 major Japanese cities. A March 1945 raid set Japan’s capital city of Tokyo on fire, leaving 1 million people homeless. Japanese factories were destroyed, and food became so scarce that many people neared starvation. Even with the widespread loss of life and damage to the environment, Japan refused to surrender.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3883bd1760544468acb98832ace5375c"> Two of the war’s fiercest battles occurred on Japan’s outer islands early in 1945. In February U.S. Marines stormed the beaches of Iwo Jima, now known as Iwo To. Japanese defenders were dug into caves, with orders to fight to the death. “On Iwo, we hardly ever saw the enemy,” recalled one marine. After the marines raised the American flag on Iwo Jima, a month of bloody fighting followed. Of more than 20,000 Japanese defenders on Iwo Jima, about a thousand were taken prisoner—the rest were killed or wounded in battle. About 6,800 Americans had died.<br />

        <p data-uuid="a7516dadec754e3ab0d503e50b44c81b">In the waters near the island, Japanese planes struck U.S. ships with the tactic of <b><dfn title="kamikaze">kamikaze</dfn></b>—purposely crashing piloted planes into enemy ships. In wave after wave, kamikaze pilots flew planes loaded with explosives straight down onto the decks of Allied ships. An American sailor who was on the deck of an aircraft carrier when a kamikaze attacked the ship described the scene. The plane “cartwheeled the length of the carrier and plowed into the planes we had on the [flight deck]. We were burning bow to stern . . . All the guys manning the guns were dead. Standing up. Pointing their guns. They never left their posts.” </p>

The fighting on Okinawa lasted nearly three months and led to terrible casualties. By the time the island was secure, some 12,000 Allied troops were dead and 36,000 wounded. The Japanese losses were staggering—some 110,000 troops and 80,000 civilians had been killed. </p>
