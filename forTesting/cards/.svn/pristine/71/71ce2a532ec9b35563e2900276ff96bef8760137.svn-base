        <p data-uuid="98066322357a454c987d9ca44a80dcdd">One of the most important defenses of the Constitution appeared in a series of essays that became known as the <dfn title="Federalist Papers"><i>Federalist Papers</i></dfn>. These essays supporting the Constitution were written anonymously under the name Publius. They were actually written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bc65617d5cde481b9420b7db9334b6b4">The authors of the <i>Federalist Papers</i> tried to reassure Americans that the new federal government would not overpower the states. In <i>Federalist Paper </i>No. 10, Madison argued that the diversity of the United States would prevent any single group from dominating the government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5d52a3c9903b4731be67d8e8870c3c67"> The <i>Federalist Papers</i> were widely reprinted in newspapers around the country as the debate over the Constitution continued. Finally, they were collected and published in book form in 1788.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3df990e492664be39eb13692eb775cf0">The Constitution needed only nine states to pass it. However, to establish and preserve national unity, each state needed to ratify it. Every state except Rhode Island held special state conventions that gave citizens the chance to discuss and vote on the Constitution.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2b38baf46f7542d3b034010e9e5ff5e5"> Paul Revere served on a committee supporting ratification. He wrote of the Constitution, “The proposed . . . government, is well calculated [planned] to secure the liberties, protect the property, and guard the rights of the citizens of America.” Antifederalists also spoke out in state conventions, and wrote articles and pamphlets that became known as the Antifederalist Papers. In New York, one citizen said, “It appears that the government will fall into the hands of the few and the great.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="9054a39d862b43e58044a81ece8e50ed"> Political leaders across America knew the new government needed the support of the large states of Virginia and New York, where debate still raged. Finally, Madison and fellow Virginia Federalists convinced Virginia to ratify it in mid-1788. In New York, riots had occurred when the draft of the Constitution was made public. At the state convention in Poughkeepsie to discuss ratification, Hamilton and Jay argued convincingly against the Antifederalists led by DeWitt Clinton. When news arrived of Virginia's ratification, New York ratified it as well. Rhode Island was the last state to ratify the Constitution in May 1790</p>
