        <p data-uuid="1e177dbe5ceb456f8284c6e7c9cd8514">In the early 1700s revolutions in both religious and nonreligious thought transformed the Western world. These movements began in Europe and affected life in the American colonies.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e33f184406f44ad884a63338d8122574">Great Awakening</h3>
        <p data-uuid="4d50c440dce348b78cafa2273646308c">After years of population growth, religious leaders wanted to spread religious feeling throughout the colonies. In the late 1730s these ministers began holding revivals, emotional gatherings where people came together to hear sermons.</p>
        <p data-uuid="20a2fd2288ed426c85cac57e32837c49"> Many American colonists experienced “a great awakening” in their religious lives. This <b><dfn title="Great Awakening">Great Awakening</dfn></b>—a religious movement that swept through the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s—changed colonial religion. It also affected social and political life. <b><dfn title="Edwards, Jonathan">Jonathan Edwards</dfn></b> of Massachusetts was one of the most important leaders of the Great Awakening. His dramatic sermons told sinners to seek forgiveness for their sins or face punishment in Hell forever. British minister George Whitefield held revivals from Georgia to New England. <br />

Ministers like Whitefield emphasized personal religious experiences over official church rules. The value placed on individuals of all types during the Great Awakening helped shape American political ideas about who should have a say in government.</p>

        <p data-uuid="dbd1386d94044e9fa8f8f7e77b902bbf">The Great Awakening drew people of different regions, classes, and races. Women, members of minority groups, and poor people often took part in services. Ministers from different colonies met and shared ideas with one another. This represented one of the few exchanges between people from different colonies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c85cd355c8b04759813bc0aa5f12f7bf">The Great Awakening promoted ideas and virtues that may also have affected colonial politics. Sermons about the spiritual equality of all people led some colonists to begin demanding more political equality. Revivals became popular places to talk about political and social issues. People from those colonies with less political freedom were thus introduced to more democratic systems used in other colonies.</p>

        <p data-uuid="dfa9c12740d5498aa5a4de586a779965">During the 1600s Europeans began to reexamine their world. Scientists began to better understand the basic laws that govern nature. Their new ideas about the universe began the Scientific Revolution. The revolution changed how people thought of the world.</p>

This movement, which took place during the 1700s, spread the idea that reason and logic could improve society. Enlightenment thinkers also formed ideas about how government should work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="75aebd13d3bb4cfbb130929f88253b0f"> Some Enlightenment thinkers believed that there was a social contract between government and citizens. Philosophers such as <b><dfn title="Locke, John">John Locke</dfn></b> thought that people had natural rights such as equality and liberty. Ideas of the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment eventually influenced colonial leaders.<br />
