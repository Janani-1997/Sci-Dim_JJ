        <p data-uuid="bc7f46dbcf544c238260a62569b00fd1">Lincoln had been impressed with General Grant’s successes in capturing Vicksburg. He transferred Grant to the East and gave him command of the Union army. In early 1864 Grant forced Lee to fight a series of battles in Virginia that stretched Confederate soldiers and supplies to their limits.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="a9fbcf7922e544948692f398ca4cc125">Wilderness Campaign in the East</h3>
        <p data-uuid="42296beb27e841378b91625d060fc74d">From May through June, the armies fought in northern and central Virginia. Union troops launched the <b><dfn title="Wilderness Campaign">Wilderness Campaign</dfn></b>—a series of battles designed to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. The first battle took place in early May, in woods about 50 miles outside of Richmond. Grant then ordered General Meade to Spotsylvania, where the fighting raged for five days.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b534faa129364547aeb9738759f66155"> Over the next month, Union soldiers moved the Confederate troops back toward Richmond. However, Grant experienced his worst defeat at the Battle of Cold Harbor in early June, just ten miles northeast of Richmond. In only a few hours, the Union army suffered 7,000 casualties. The battle delayed Grant’s plans to take the Confederate capital.<br />

        <p data-uuid="d8e7e2ac9173448b800cf8ac60853d72">Union forces had suffered twice as many casualties as the Confederates had, yet Grant continued his strategy. He knew he would be getting additional soldiers, and Lee could not. Grant slowly but surely advanced his troops through Virginia. He told another officer, “I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="f2379fd0ab58478a8d055b4f7c43ddc4">After Cold Harbor, General Grant moved south of Richmond. He had hoped to take control of the key railroad junction at Petersburg, Virginia. Lee’s army, however, formed a solid defense, and Grant could not execute his attack. Grant was winning the war, but he still had not captured Richmond. Facing reelection, Lincoln was especially discouraged by this failure.</p>

        <p data-uuid="30cf1f14c94d42d899f09c882ab12667">In the spring of 1864, Sherman marched south from Tennessee with 100,000 troops. His goal was to take Atlanta, Georgia, and knock out an important railroad link. From May through August, Sherman’s army moved steadily through the Appalachians toward Atlanta. Several times, Sherman avoided defenses set up by Confederate general Joseph Johnston.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9d4e5e04512545629e7424358efc078d">In July Sherman was within sight of Atlanta. Confederate president Jefferson Davis gave General John Hood command of Confederate forces in the region. Hood repeatedly attacked Sherman in a final attempt to save Atlanta, but the Union troops proved stronger. The Confederate troops retreated as Sherman held Atlanta under siege.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ccc220ca7a52400ebc2a2d97eae93ec9"> Atlanta fell to Sherman’s troops on September 2, 1864. Much of the city was destroyed by artillery and fire. Sherman ordered the residents who still remained to leave. Responding to his critics, Sherman later wrote, “War is war, and not popularity-seeking.” The loss of Atlanta cost the South an important railroad link and its center of industry.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9f55ea6a7c824236b233aa9b7e604db2">Many people in the North had been upset with the length of the war. However, the capture of Atlanta showed that progress was being made in defeating the South. This success helped to convince Union voters to reelect Lincoln in a landslide.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5fe3cc5d6c724da4a25a1380d418f138">Sherman did not wait long to begin his next campaign. His goal was the port city of Savannah, Georgia. In mid-November 1864, Sherman left Atlanta with a force of about 60,000 men. He said he would “make Georgia howl!”</p>
        <p data-uuid="dabb386f7a4f4731951bce4cb53984b6">During his March to the Sea, Sherman practiced <b><dfn title="total war">total war</dfn></b>—destroying civilian and economic resources. Sherman believed that total war would ruin the South’s economy and its ability to fight. He ordered his troops to destroy railways, bridges, crops, livestock, and other resources. They burned plantations and freed slaves.</p>
        <p data-uuid="db89e9dc55744e18831db2d59addaf05"> Sherman’s army reached Savannah on December 10, 1864. They left behind a path of destruction 60 miles wide. Sherman believed that this march would speed the end of the war. He wanted to break the South’s will to fight by marching Union troops through the heart of the Confederacy. In the end, Sherman’s destruction of the South led to anger and resentment toward the people of the North that would last for generations.</p>
