        <p data-uuid="3924f8e3596f4c18a8e809888305bdae">Since the
            beginning of slavery in the United States, enslaved people made efforts to
            escape their difficult lives. However, the number of escape attempts increased
            sharply during the 1830s. These courageous slaves may have been encouraged by a
            small movement that was gaining support in the North. The <b><dfn title="abolition movement">abolition movement</dfn></b> was a campaign to abolish, or end, slavery. This
            movement grew into one of the largest reform movements of the mid-1800s. No
            other movement attracted as many followers or had such an impact on the history
            of the United States. Supporters of the abolition movement were called
            abolitionists, and they included men and women as well as blacks and whites
            from both the North and the South. </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="267751b5b09645418622e9d42329e3fb">Religious
            Roots</h3>
        <p data-uuid="33827f4a04dd40dba2aa78c108447ff1">The abolition movement had deep roots in religion. Since the colonial
            period, the Quakers were among the first groups to challenge slavery on
            religious grounds, believing it to be immoral. Pennsylvania, with many Quaker
            residents, was a center of activity, with the Pennsylvania Abolition Society
            established in 1775. Other religious leaders published pamphlets and gave
            speeches that encouraged many Americans to support the cause. </p>
        <p data-uuid="eb6fe35d196a46b6b06315ecb79fbf11">The rebirth of religious fervor
            in the Second Great Awakening also contributed to the rise of the abolition
            movement. Many religious people in the North
            saw slavery as a clear moral wrong that went directly against their beliefs.
            Many joined reform societies to campaign against slavery. By 1836 more than 500
            of these groups existed. </p>
        <p data-uuid="8f014d1a9b9c4d8791834d1f8b55558e">
            However, antislavery reformers did not always agree
            on the details. They differed over how much equality they thought African Americans
            should have.&#160;Some believed that African Americans should be treated as
            equal to white Americans, while others were against full
            political and social equality. <b><dfn title="Mott, Lucretia">Lucretia Mott</dfn></b> founded the Philadelphia
            Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1833, when women were prohibited from joining
            the American Anti-Slavery Society. This organization, unlike some others, had
            both white and black members from its beginnings.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="7bd01f76cce34b8aacbfac161cd513c6">Abolitionist Leaders</h3>
        <p data-uuid="889902d97e584a41b2c3ba6313871b95">One of the most outspoken abolitionists was a Philadelphia
            journalist named <b><dfn title="Garrison, William Lloyd">William Lloyd Garrison</dfn></b>. In 1828 he was convinced by a
            Quaker friend to join the abolition movement and soon became its leading
            spokesperson. Although many abolitionists favored a gradual abolition of
            slavery, Garrison demanded that it be abolished immediately. In 1831 he began publishing
            an abolitionist newspaper called the <i>Liberator</i>. He continued to publish the paper until slavery was
            abolished 35&#160;years later. </p>
        <p data-uuid="24d4b638849c4065bda2f96ffc51c82a">In 1833 he helped found the <b><dfn title="American Anti-Slavery Society">American
            Anti-Slavery Society</dfn></b>, the most influential abolitionist group to call for the immediate end to
            slavery in the United States. By 1840 the society’s membership was almost
            200,000. In the same year, however, the society split into two groups. One
            wanted immediate freedom for enslaved African Americans and a bigger role for
            women. The other wanted gradual emancipation and for women to play a minor role
            in the movement.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6b6dfbedb5a34a2d9e46bbc25bf8c9cc">
            As in
            other reform movements of the time, however, women played a major role in the
            abolition campaign. Two outspoken campaigners for the movement were <b><dfn title="Grimk&#233;, Angelina">Angelina and Sarah Grimk&#233;</dfn></b>.
            Daughters of a South Carolina plantation owner, the Grimk&#233; sisters witnessed
            the suffering of slaves firsthand. Angelina Grimk&#233; wrote a pamphlet trying to
            recruit other white southern women to the cause. Their vocal and public support
            of the movement earned them the disapproval of their community. They eventually
            moved to the North, where they not only fought against slavery but also for the
            rights of women. After moving to Philadelphia, the sisters wrote <i>American
            Slavery As It Is</i>. This book was considered to be one of the most important
            antislavery works of its time.<br />
