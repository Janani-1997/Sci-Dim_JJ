        <p data-uuid="83c45c4fb64347beb69507e8975c4774">Another challenge facing America in the early 1800s was poor public education. During this era, childhood was beginning to be viewed as a separate stage of life in which education was of the utmost importance in creating responsible citizens. However, many children worked in factories or on farms to help support their families. If children could read the Bible, write, and do simple math, that was often considered to be enough.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="0a3c5502ce8b4841b1126f70f03a1fab">Education in the Early 1800s</h3>
        <p data-uuid="934b1d50a963464985c1249828e7dde3">The availability of education varied widely. New England had the most schools, while the South and the West had the fewest. Few teachers were trained. Schoolhouses were small, and students of all ages and levels worked in one room.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3e534461bd1a402eaead7cc129af7c80"><i>McGuffey’s Readers</i> were the most popular textbooks. William Holmes McGuffey, an educator and minister, put selections from British and American literature in them as well as instruction in moral and social values.</p>
        <p data-uuid="25ece91fa62541b59b18e0571a00d048">Social background and wealth affected the quality of education. Rich families sent children to private schools or hired tutors. However, poor children had only public schools. Girls could go to school, but parents usually thought that girls needed little education and kept them home. Therefore, few girls learned to read.</p>

            <p data-uuid="75a06a0e86524073a068d9dab5658296">Born in Franklin, Massachusetts, Mann had little schooling, but he educated himself well enough at the local library to get into Brown University and attend law school. Despite a busy law practice, he served in the Massachusetts legislature for ten years. He was also an outspoken advocate for public education. In 1837 the state created the post of secretary of education for him. His achievements in that office made him famous. He later served in the U.S. House of Representatives and as president of Antioch College in Ohio. His influence on education is reflected by the fact that many American schools are named for him.</p>

He convinced the state to double its school budget and raise teachers’ salaries. He lengthened the school year and began the first school for teacher training. Mann’s success set a standard for education reform throughout the country.</p>

The first college-level educational institution available to women was the Troy Female Seminary, opened by Emma Willard in 1821.
