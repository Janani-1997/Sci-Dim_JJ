        <p data-uuid="0f6f5c86ec834ccab5510c659d5ec26d">Religious tensions in England remained high after the Protestant Reformation. A Protestant group called the <b><dfn title="Puritans">Puritans</dfn></b> wanted to purify, or reform, the Anglican Church. The Puritans thought that bishops and priests had too much power over church members.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="734988ad092548e2be26e9d35f444687">Pilgrims on the Move</h3>
        <p data-uuid="79d9b0f0e99243379ca9ec0a782a1644">The most extreme English Protestants wanted to separate from the Church of England. These Separatists formed their own churches and cut all ties with the Church of England. In response, Anglican leaders began to punish Separatists.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0defaece1de3442b89d8d33c2870e18d">The <b><dfn title="Pilgrim">Pilgrims</dfn></b> were one Separatist group that left England in the early 1600s to escape persecution. The Pilgrims moved to the Netherlands in 1608. The Pilgrims were <b><dfn title="immigrant">immigrants</dfn></b>—people who have left the country of their birth to live in another country.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b65b76ccaafd4de590fe986c4309daee">The Pilgrims were glad to be able to practice their religion freely. They were not happy, however, that their children were learning the Dutch language and culture. The Pilgrims feared that their children would forget their English traditions. The Pilgrims decided to leave Europe altogether. They formed a joint-stock company with some merchants and then received permission from England to settle in the American colony of Virginia.</p>
        <p data-uuid="361722a957a44954939b7cc715ff72cf"> On September 16, 1620, a ship called the <i>Mayflower</i> left England with more than 100 men, women, and children aboard. Not all of these colonists were Pilgrims. However, Pilgrim leaders such as William Bradford sailed with the group.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="ac905715390049198ca2f96e00d1c342">The Mayflower Compact</h3>
        <p data-uuid="dea0a5aab7f64a769ec08670823e44bb">After two months of rough ocean travel, the Pilgrims sighted land far north of Virginia. The Pilgrims knew that they would thus be outside the authority of Virginia’s colonial government when they landed. Their charter would not apply. So, they decided to establish their own basic laws and social rules to govern the colony they would found.</p>
        <p data-uuid="73281aabca0c4b41bb867eeb27cd1b1a">On November 21, 1620, 41 of the male passengers on the ship signed the <b><dfn title="Mayflower Compact">Mayflower Compact</dfn></b>, a legal contract in which they agreed to have fair laws to protect the general good. The compact represents one of the first attempts at self-government in the English colonies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="89e2723959854fe4a3471b716d180c2a"> In late 1620 the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in present-day Massachusetts. The colonists struggled through the winter to build the Plymouth settlement. Nearly half died during this first winter from sickness and the freezing weather.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ae3ef0cfa8fe4e1f8ecf97c95e17a962">In March 1621 a Native American named Samoset walked boldly into the colonists’ settlement. He spoke in broken English. Samoset had learned some English from the crews of English fishing boats. He gave the Pilgrims useful information about the peoples and places of the area. He also introduced them to a Patuxet Indian named <b><dfn title="Tisquantum">Tisquantum</dfn></b>, or Squanto. Tisquantum had at one time lived in Europe and spoke English as well.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ce768ab7e5b540799f55cb9abe6e7e2f"> From Tisquantum the Pilgrims learned to fertilize the soil with fish remains. He also helped the Pilgrims establish relations with the local Wampanoag Indians. Conditions in Plymouth Colony soon began to improve.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="785bc638a5de4574bc9947002c0bbcca">Thanksgiving</h3>
        <p data-uuid="48324ac739ff41778a93e9698f774f91">In the fall of 1621, the Pilgrims gathered their first harvest. William Bradford, governor of Plymouth Colony, decided they should have a celebration so that people could give thanks to God. He invited Wampanoag chief Massasoit and 90 other guests to celebrate their harvest. This is what many people today think of as the first Thanksgiving. However, Thanksgiving celebrations, such as the Green Corn Ceremony, have been held by Native Americans for thousands of years. The Pilgrims’ Thanksgiving feast included wild turkeys, fish, and lobsters. This event marked the survival of the Pilgrims in the new colony.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="af9a02654dea4895bc56cdc0f67805c6">Pilgrim Community</h3>
        <p data-uuid="7dffebd7b12d446e81393952a14c9045">Although the Pilgrims overcame many problems, their small settlement still struggled. Most Pilgrims became farmers, but the farmland around their settlement was poor. They had hoped to make money by trading furs and by fishing. Unfortunately, fishing and hunting conditions were not good in the area. Some colonists traded corn with Native Americans for beaver furs. The Pilgrims made little money but were able to form a strong community. The colony began to grow stronger in the mid-1620s after new settlers arrived and, as in Jamestown, colonists began to have more rights to farm their own land.</p>
        <p data-uuid="eddb47eadf5b44ddaa6e8486bb24a0e1">The Pilgrims’ settlement was different from Virginia’s in that it had many families. The Pilgrims taught their children to read and offered some education to their indentured servants. Families served as centers of religious life, health care, and community well-being.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5c2641f30d2a4bb6a55df57fa08ba33e">All family members worked together to survive during the early years of the colony. Women generally cooked, spun and wove wool, and sewed clothing. They also made soap and butter, carried water, dried fruit, and cared for livestock. Men spent most of their time repairing tools and working in the fields. They also chopped wood and built shelters.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="171f00556d464630a397e38ff07956db">Women in the Colony</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a4c7fb754db0475fa2d3137d894349fa">In Plymouth, women had more legal rights than they did in England. In England, women were not allowed to make contracts, to sue, or to own property. In America, Pilgrim women had the right to sign contracts and to bring some cases before local courts. Widows could also own property. </p>
        <p data-uuid="66892eb6eff94b0fa0beb88a579debde"> From time to time, local courts recognized the ways women helped the business community. Widow Naomi Silvester received a large share of her husband’s estate. The court called her “a frugal [thrifty] and laborious [hardworking] woman.”</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="2d2ed0694ede4ebf823cbfbd17e3d863">Puritans Leave England</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9a4f3fa2e2754c4884342766a3ee563a"> During the 1620s England’s economy suffered. Many people lost their jobs. The English king, Charles I, made the situation worse by raising taxes. This unpopular act led to a political crisis. At the same time, the Church of England began to punish Puritans because they were dissenters, or people who disagree with official opinions. King Charles refused to allow Puritans to criticize church actions.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="2c16b536c706491bb7145fd0bcb2a769">Great Migration</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3c9e8f559cde4caf847b843a99da82c9">These economic, political, and religious problems in England led to the Great Migration. Between 1629 and 1640 many thousands of English men, women, and children left England. More than 40,000 of these people moved to English colonies in New England and the Caribbean. In 1629 Charles granted a group of Puritans and merchants a charter to settle in New England. The group formed the Massachusetts Bay Company.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b41b61d80258448aba0f6640e456f4dc">In 1630 a group of Puritan colonists seeking religious freedom sailed on a fleet of ships from England to Massachusetts. They were led by <b><dfn title="Winthrop, John">John Winthrop</dfn></b>. The Puritans believed that they had made a covenant, or promise, with God to build an ideal Christian community.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="1114a6bb76e1442ab106542478fcfbcc">A New Colony</h3>
        <p data-uuid="bb6027e5d2b649969f272e614a71b483"> The Puritans arrived in New England well prepared to start their colony. They brought large amounts of tools and livestock with them. Like the Pilgrims, the Puritans faced little resistance from local Native Americans. Trade with Plymouth Colony helped them, too. In addition, the region around Boston had a fairly healthful climate. Thus, few Puritans died from sickness. All of these things helped Massachusetts Bay Colony do well. By 1691 Massachusetts Bay Colony had expanded to include the Pilgrims’ Plymouth Colony.</p>
