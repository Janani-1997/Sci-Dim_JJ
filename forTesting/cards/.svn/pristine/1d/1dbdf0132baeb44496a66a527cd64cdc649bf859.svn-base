        <p data-uuid="e3f3c342f54b4ceeabe9832a9d4ac7ef">Soon, a presidential election also brought controversy. In the presidential election of 1824, both <b><dfn title="Adams, John Quincy">John Quincy Adams</dfn></b>, Henry Clay, and two other candidates lost the popular vote to Andrew Jackson. However, no candidate had enough electoral votes to win office. According to the Constitution, when this happens, the House of Representatives must choose the winner.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ed4a0439e76e446c9afbbb1de1276ef2"> Clay, who had come in fourth, threw his support behind Adams. When the House chose Adams as president, Jackson’s supporters claimed that Adams and Clay had made a “corrupt bargain.” These accusations grew after Adams chose Clay to be secretary of state. Adams and Clay denied any wrongdoing, but the suspicions remained.<br />

        <p data-uuid="728909cb6e1e436ca150ae29cadff3d0">Adams had enjoyed great success as secretary of state, but the election controversy weakened his support. So, too, did his stern and reserved personality. One observer complained that Adams seemed “hard as a piece of granite and cold as a lump of ice.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="d3a2dc8fe7294668961dc87734e03858"> As president, Adams faced near constant opposition from Jackson’s supporters in Congress. He proposed strongly nationalist policies. He wanted to build roads and canals, found a national university, and create a standardized system of measures. Unfortunately, Congress defeated most of his proposals.<br />
