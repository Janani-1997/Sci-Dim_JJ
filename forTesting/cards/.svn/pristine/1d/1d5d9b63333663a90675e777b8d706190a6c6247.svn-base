        <p data-uuid="09bcb9400a2d476094128cde3d8ec7e3">The cattle industry was another area of rapid growth. Following the Civil War, a growing economy and population created a greater demand for beef in the East. Cattle worth $3 to $6 each in Texas could be sold for $38 each in Kansas. In New York, they could be sold for $80 each. The most popular breed of cattle was the longhorn. The longhorn spread quickly throughout western Texas. Because these animals needed very little water and could survive harsh weather, they were well suited to the dry, desert-like environment of western Texas. But how could Texas ranchers move the longhorns to eastern markets? In 1867 businessman Joseph McCoy discovered a solution. He built pens for cattle in the small town of Abilene, Kansas. The Kansas Pacific Railroad line went through Abilene. As a result, cattle could be shipped by rail from there. Soon, countless Texas ranchers were making the trip north to Abilene to sell their herds of cattle.<br />

        <p data-uuid="ab81f644f95e4ebb99a98bd956f86d35">Around the same time, cattle ranching began to expand in the Midwest. The Great Plains from Texas to Canada, where many ranchers raised cattle in the late 1800s, became known as the <b><dfn title="Cattle Kingdom">Cattle Kingdom</dfn></b>. Ranchers grazed huge herds on public land called the open range. The land had once been occupied by Plains Indians and buffalo herds.</p>

                <p data-uuid="76cd90706fcf4eb1a66fc9756dd11bfb">The workers who took care of the ranchers’ cattle were known as cowhands or cowboys. They adopted many techniques and tools from <i>vaqueros</i> (bah-KER-ohs), Mexican ranch hands who cared for cattle and horses. From vaqueros came the western saddle and the lariat—a rope used for lassoing cattle. The cowboys also borrowed the vaqueros’ broad felt hat. However, they changed it into the familiar high-peaked cowboy hat.</p>

On these long journeys, cowboys herded cattle to the market or to the northern Plains for grazing. The trips usually lasted several months and covered hundreds of miles. The <b><dfn title="Chisholm Trail">Chisholm Trail</dfn></b>, which ran from San Antonio, Texas, to the cattle town of Abilene, Kansas, was one of the earliest and most popular routes for cattle drives. It was blazed, or marked, by Texas cowboy Jesse Chisholm in the late 1860s.<br />

Farmers began to buy range land on the Great Plains where cattle had once grazed. Small ranchers also began competing with large ranchers for land. Then in 1874 the invention of barbed wire allowed westerners to fence off large amounts of land cheaply. The competition between farmers, large ranchers, and small ranchers increased. This competition led to range wars, or fights for access to land.</p>

The huge cattle herds on the Plains had eaten most of the prairie grass. Unusually severe winters in both years made the ranching situation even worse. Thousands of cattle died, and many ranchers were ruined financially. The Cattle Kingdom had come to an end.</p>
