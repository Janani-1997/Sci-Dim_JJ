        <p data-uuid="53ce6215d0e94f31954392716203680f">Generally, slaveholders viewed slaves as property, not as people. Slaveholders bought and sold slaves to make a profit. The most common method of sale was at an auction. The auction itself determined whether families would be kept together or separated. Sometimes a buyer wanted a slave to fill a specific position, such as heavy laborer, carpenter, or blacksmith. The buyer might be willing to pay for the slave who could do the work, but not for that slave’s family. Families would then be separated, with little hope of ever getting back together.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9142a74963ed4dfbb7369df8a9920c3c"> Slave traders sometimes even kidnapped free African Americans and then sold them into slavery. For example, Solomon Northup, a free African American, was kidnapped in Washington, DC. He spent 12 years as a slave until he finally proved his identity and gained his release.<br />

        <p data-uuid="4e10efd0e36e43eb8608e3104eabade5">Enslaved people often endured poor living conditions. Planters housed them in dirt-floor cabins with few furnishings and often leaky roofs. The clothing given to them was usually simple and made of cheap, coarse fabric. Some slaves tried to brighten up their clothing by sewing on designs from discarded scraps of material. In this way, they expressed their individuality and personalized the clothing assigned to them by the planters. Likewise, many slaves did what they could to improve their small food rations. Some planters allowed slaves to keep their own gardens for vegetables and chickens for eggs. Other slaves were able to add a little variety to their diet by fishing or picking wild berries.</p>

We always slept on the floor, pallet here, and a pallet there. Just like, uh, lot of, uh, wild people, we didn’t, we didn't know nothing. Didn’t allow you to look at no book. And then there was some free born colored people, why they had a little education, but there was very few of them, where we was. And they all had uh, what you call, I might call it now, uh, jail centers, was just the same as we was in jail. Now I couldn’t go from here across the street, or I couldn't go through nobody’s house without I have a note, or something from my master. And if I had that pass, that was what we call a pass, if I had that pass, I could go wherever he sent me. And I’d have to be back, you know, when uh. Whoever he sent me to, they, they’d give me another pass and I’d bring that back so as to show how long I'd been gone. We couldn’t go out and stay a hour or two hours or something like. They send you. Now, say for instance I’d’s place. I’d have to walk. And I would have to be back maybe in a hour. Maybe they’d give me hour. I don’t know just how long they’d give me. But they’d give me a note so there wouldn’t nobody interfere with me, and tell who I belong to. And when I come back, why I carry it to my master and give that to him, that’d be all right. But I couldn’t just walk away like the people does now, you know. It was what they call, we were slaves. We belonged to people. They’d sell us like they sell horses and cows and hogs and all like that. Have a auction bench, and they’d put you on, up on the bench and bid on you just same as you bidding on cattle you know.</p>
