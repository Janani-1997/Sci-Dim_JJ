        <p data-uuid="60c1a4c41003464ea55bad04ce1f05a6">The first Red Scare swept America after the
            Russian Revolution in 1917. Cold War fears led to another Red Scare in the late
            1940s and 1950s. Attorney General J. Howard McGrath summed up these fears when he
            said, “There are today many Communists in America. They are everywhere—in
            factories, offices, butcher shops, on street corners.”</p>

            of Communists</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f2725d5527d3480f8fc7cfdb33568e74">A congressional committee called the House Un-American
            Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated Communist influence in America. In
            1947 HUAC launched a series of hearings to expose what it believed was
            Communist influence in the Hollywood movie industry. The committee branded as “red,”
            or Communist, actors and writers who would not answer questions or who refused
            to reveal the names of suspected Communists. People suspected of Communist
            &#173;sympathies were often blacklisted, or denied work. Some of these people never
            worked in movies again.&#160;<br />

                    <p class="source" data-uuid="f2f3a7ce606c4742af6b6c37b88da063">In the 1950s the fear of communism caused some
                        government leaders to ignore the civil liberties of suspected Communists. Some
                        critics, like this cartoonist, believed these tactics threatened the freedom of
                        all Americans. Here, a frightened man climbs the arm of the Statue of Liberty
                        to put out her torch.</p>

            work in the United States. In 1950 a German-born physicist was convicted of providing
            the Soviets information about the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos, New
            Mexico, that allowed them to develop an atomic bomb at least one year earlier
            than they would have. In 1951 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg also were tried for
            providing Soviet spies with secret details about atomic bomb design. The
            Rosenbergs denied the charges but were found guilty and executed in 1953.</p>

            to fears in the early 1950s by charging that Communists were working inside the
            State Department. He claimed to have the names of 57 people who were “either
            card-carrying members or certainly loyal to the Communist Party.”</p>

            McCarthy produced no
            concrete proof of crimes. Many people spoke out about McCarthy’s accusations in
            which he had no proof. When challenged, he made up new charges, labeling those
            who questioned him as “soft on communism.” This method of making aggressive
            accusations without proof became known as McCarthyism.</p>

            too far in 1954. In televised Senate hearings he charged that there were
            Communists in the U.S. Army. For five weeks Americans watched McCarthy’s bullying
            tactics. At one point McCarthy tried to discredit Joseph Welch, the army’s
            attorney, by attacking a young assistant in Welch’s law firm. This shocked
            Welch—and the nation—&#173;watching the hearings on television. “Let us not
            assassinate this lad further, Senator,” Welch said. “Have you left no sense of
            decency?” A later Senate vote condemned McCarthy’s actions, but it came too
            late for those whose careers had been ruined by his attacks.</p>
