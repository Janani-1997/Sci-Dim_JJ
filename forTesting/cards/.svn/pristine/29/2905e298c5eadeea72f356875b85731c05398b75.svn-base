        <p data-uuid="85324bc6760548719636df5b3d36e44f">After the Civil Works Administration ended in 1934, Congress formed a new agency to provide jobs for unemployed Americans. Between 1935 and 1943, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed some 8.5 million people on tens of thousands of projects all over the country. WPA employees built more than 650,000 miles of roads; 75,000 bridges; 8,000 parks; and 800 airports. WPA workers built the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington and New York City’s Lincoln Tunnel. They also built prisons, swimming pools, hospitals, and courthouses. </p>

She was concerned, however, that the WPA was not solving the problem of unemployment among young Americans in their teens and early twenties. “I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation,” she said. “We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary.” The First Lady helped convince the president to create the National Youth Administration (NYA). The NYA gave part-time jobs to many students. These jobs allowed young workers to stay in school and help their families. One NYA worker said, “I tell you, the first time I walked through the front door with my paycheck, I was somebody!"<br />

To help pay for these programs, the law placed a new tax on workers and employers. The passage of the Social Security Act marked the first time the federal government took direct responsibility for many citizens’ economic well-being. In a national radio address, Secretary of Labor Perkins told Americans she believed Social Security was “a most significant step in our national development, a milestone in our progress toward the better-ordered society.” Social Security is still an important financial safety net for many Americans. Nine out of ten individuals over the age of 65 receive benefits from the program.<br />

        <p data-uuid="52c9bd3c6ccc486ca10255c0a146e990">In response to this setback, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). This law is sometimes called the Wagner Act, after its sponsor, Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York. This law allowed workers to join labor unions and work together for better working conditions or salaries with collective bargaining. It also established the National Labor Relations Board to oversee union activities. Union membership grew after the passage of the Wagner Act. Organized labor became a powerful political force. </p>
        <p data-uuid="e0f9abbb9fe9468e9c9ef9f106366bd3">At the start of the Depression, many skilled workers belonged to craft unions. Such unions were often associated with the American Federation of Labor, which had existed since the 1880s. Unskilled workers, however, such as those who worked on assembly lines, did not qualify to belong to AFL unions. In 1935 a new union called the <b><dfn title="Congress of Industrial Organizations">Congress of Industrial Organizations</dfn></b> (CIO) organized workers into unions based on industry, not skill level. For example, all workers in the automobile industry would belong to the same union. The CIO also welcomed African American and Hispanic members, as well as women and immigrants. </p>
        <p data-uuid="daacec16b7774df485eb247197fc400b"> Unions led a number of major strikes during the Depression. On New Year’s Eve 1936, the CIO went on strike against General Motors for 44 days. Instead of leaving the buildings as strikers usually did, workers stayed in the factories so they could not be replaced by new workers. This strategy became known as the <b><dfn title="sit-down strike">sit-down strike</dfn></b>. The success of the General Motors strike attracted more workers to CIO unions.<br />
