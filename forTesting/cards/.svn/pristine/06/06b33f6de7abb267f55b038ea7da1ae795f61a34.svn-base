        <p data-uuid="eb9744a98c534ffd8ca3fcc7ca92e05b">By the 1670s tensions had arisen between New England colonists and the Wampanoag. Metacomet, a Wampanoag leader also known as King Philip, opposed the colonists’ efforts to take his people’s lands. In 1675 these tensions finally erupted in a conflict known as King Philip’s War. The colonial militia—civilians serving as soldiers—fought Native American warriors. Both sides attacked each other’s settlements, killing men, women, and children. The fighting finally ended in 1676, but only after about 600 colonists and some 3,000 Native Americans had been killed, including Metacomet.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="0be475ac8c7c4042b6af5d215cf949d8">Native American Allies</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d9fea11fee0241e4b61e06d4b6c26f93">Some Native Americans allied with the colonists to fight against Metacomet and his forces. These Native Americans had developed trade relations with colonists. They wanted tools, weapons, and other goods that Europeans could provide. In exchange, the colonists wanted furs, which they sold for large profits in Europe. As a result, each side came to depend upon the other.</p>
        <p data-uuid="21021f5db68940eb8a914545d2758d79"> French colonists traded and allied with the Algonquian and Huron. English colonists traded and allied with the Iroquois League, in the New York colony. This powerful group united Native Americans from six different groups. Many Native Americans trusted the French more than they did the English. The smaller French settlements were less threatening than the rapidly growing English colonies.<br />

        <p data-uuid="9acec5c8099d4f4d90707e57e32029e7">Until the mid-1700s France and Great Britain struggled for control of territory in North America. British colonists wanted to settle in the Ohio River valley, where they could take advantage of the valuable fur trade. The French believed this settlement would hurt their fur trade profits. A standoff developed in the Ohio River valley where the French had built three forts. Fighting erupted in 1753 as the British military moved to take over the valley.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f13b8cfb836e44dcaf4c52a4ae6ddfde">When a young Virginian named George Washington arrived with more soldiers, he found the area under French control. Washington and his troops built a small, simple fort that he named Fort Necessity. After his troops suffered many casualties—captured, injured, or killed soldiers—Washington finally surrendered. His defeat in 1754 was the start of the French and Indian War. </p>

        <p data-uuid="5940d7cc04c34355adcef31b6244d30a">Colonial leaders, such as Benjamin Franklin, met to discuss defense. The convention produced a plan called the Albany Plan of Union, based on Franklin’s idea for uniting the colonies. The Iroquois, or Haudenosaunee as they called themselves, took part in the convention. They may have helped shape the Albany Plan with their ideas about government. Franklin published his famous “Join, or Die” political cartoon to help convince the colonies to unite. Meanwhile, in 1756 fighting began in Europe, starting what became known as the Seven Years’ War.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="3127fe9210f342aabdaec05d3a349147">Treaty of Paris</h3>
        <p data-uuid="6e32750a85d24e609181a9d7f1ea8963">The turning point of the war came in 1759. That year British general James Wolfe captured Quebec, gaining the advantage in the war. However, the war dragged on for four more years. Finally, in 1763 Britain and France signed the Treaty of Paris, officially ending the war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="78d634b8b5294d559aea2b9455205c6d"> The terms of the treaty gave Canada to Britain. Britain also gained all French lands east of the Mississippi River except the city of New Orleans and two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. From Spain, which had allied with France in 1762, Britain received Florida. Britain divided Florida into two colonies, East and West Florida. In an earlier treaty, Spain had received Louisiana, the land that France had claimed west of the Mississippi River. The Treaty of Paris changed the balance of power in North America. Soon, British settlers began moving west to settle new lands.</p>

At that time few colonists had settled the backcountry. Thick forests, steep hills, and few roads made it hard to settle. By the mid-1700s, however, many colonial settlers, or pioneers, were slowly moving into the Virginia and Carolina backcountry and the Ohio River valley. Many of these settlers were Scots-Irish immigrants. The Scots-Irish were people whose ancestors had migrated from Scotland to Ireland. A group of German immigrants called Moravians settled in the foothills of North Carolina’s backcountry mountains. They were a religious group who saw themselves as a large “family.”<br />

        <p data-uuid="ce14ce13372942d6bee247c14c4ced25">British leaders feared that more fighting would take place on the frontier if colonists kept moving onto Native American lands. To avoid more conflict, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763. This law banned British settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. The law also ordered settlers to leave the upper Ohio River valley. The right to settle and claim ownership of land was important to the colonists, so the proclamation angered them.</p>
        <p data-uuid="013b1ebe9ae24430b539c88d9c9492a9">Most colonists ignored the king’s proclamation. They believed they had fought the war to keep the French from blocking their settlement of the western frontier. They did not like the British government telling them to stay out of those lands. As a result, fighting between the settlers and the Native Americans continued. </p>
        <p data-uuid="3a59725d754848b28104c0f47203ab73">The colonists were not used to laws being strictly enforced in the colonies. Before 1763 Britain interfered very little in colonial affairs. This hands-off policy was known as <b><dfn title="salutary neglect">salutary neglect</dfn></b>. The British Parliament passed laws to help govern the colonies, but governors rarely enforced these laws. The practice of salutary neglect encouraged individualism and self-reliance in the colonies. The colonists got accustomed to acting on their own. Soon new laws would be passed by Parliament that would further anger the colonists.<br />
