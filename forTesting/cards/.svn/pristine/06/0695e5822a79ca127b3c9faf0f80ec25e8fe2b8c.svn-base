        <p data-uuid="5aa58f32e58f4e26b6db436279db07f9">The fall of the Roman Empire brought great change to Europe. Groups from the north and east of Rome moved into former Roman lands. By the early 500s, Europe was divided into many small kingdoms. The decline of Rome marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, a period that lasted about a thousand years.

        <p data-uuid="8c6aa71368ed416f9a493327e4a965af">In the 480s a powerful group called the Franks conquered Gaul, the region we now call France. The Franks created a huge empire in Europe. When invaders began to attack European settlements in the 800s, the Frankish kings could not defend their empire.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="6d93a40f36ff4f8f95b4c781e0cffc51">Because they could not depend on protection from their kings, nobles had to defend their own lands. As a result, the power of European nobles grew, and kings became less powerful. Although these nobles remained loyal to the king, they ruled their lands as independent territories.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ba0cfc17d8af41539bc675641370474c"> Nobles needed soldiers to defend their lands. Nobles gave <dfn title="knights">knights</dfn>, warriors who fought on horseback, land in exchange for military service. Nobles who gave land to knights so the knights would defend the land were called lords. A knight who promised to support the noble in battle was called a vassal. This system of promises between lords and vassals is known as feudalism.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5297d4b84cff4f0da92ed42be02cc691">Peasants owned no land, so they were not part of the feudal system. They did, however, need to grow food to live. As a result, a new economic system developed. Knights allowed peasants to farm land on their large estates, called manors. In return, the peasants had to give the knights food or other goods as payment.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="d6d5fd65f1ca45d2b1f0dc8037724969"> Because of its structure, feudalism promoted the separation of territories and people. The Catholic Church, however, served as a strong unifying force among the states and people of Europe. During the Middle Ages, nearly everyone in Europe was Christian. Life revolved around the local church with markets, festivals, and religious ceremonies.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b5c58c45c8374718bbb177f7dd7e4fac">In the late 1000s a long series of wars called the Crusades began between the European Christians and Muslims in Southwest Asia.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="429a1342b8aa4b1c977098c9134805bf"> The Turks had captured Palestine, also known as the Holy Land because it was where Jesus had lived. Christians no longer felt safe to travel there on pilgrimages. Christians were called upon to go to war with the Turks to recapture Palestine.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="64cd649c8fb64f2f8302effd910372ac">Travel, Trade, and Towns</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9b9000aff49e4aafa42462ad9f68b0ef">In the Middle Ages, towns were small. After about 1000, this situation began to change. New technology meant farmers could produce larger harvests. As farmers grew more food, the population increased.</p>
        <p data-uuid="413766e7e23646219e8621f42562317c">Travel became safer as increased protection from stronger rulers kept larger territories secure. Over time, kingdoms became nation-statesâ€”organized political units with central governments. This development provided even more protection to merchants.</p>
        <p data-uuid="67e8646d17ba413fa2f5c8369d0fae38"> The rulers of the Mongols made routes like the Silk Road (a caravan route that started in China and ended at the Mediterranean Sea) safe for travelers and traders. Among these traders was Marco Polo. In 1271 he journeyed from Europe to China along part of the old Silk Road. He spent 20 years living and traveling in Asia. When Marco Polo returned to Europe, he brought back stories of spices, coal, and paper money.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4afbb62c0cb94a988b68ef99ec36ecc3"> In time, the growth of trade helped bring about the decline of feudalism and the manor system.
