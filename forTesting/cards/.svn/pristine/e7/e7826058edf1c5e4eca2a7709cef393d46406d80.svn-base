The manufacturer who owns, say, from three or four to a dozen or more tenements <a href="[remark:8368e4b1b03f4ab4811c584020874fc9]">contiguous</a> to his shop, fills them up with these people, charging them outrageous rents, and . . . deals them out tobacco by the week, and devotes the rest of his energies to the paring down of wages to within a peg or two of the point where the tenant rebels in desperation.

They contained thirty-five families of cigarmakers, with probably not half a dozen persons in the whole lot of them, outside of the children, who could speak a word of English, though many had been in the country half a lifetime. This room with two windows giving on the street, and a rear attachment without windows, called a bedroom by courtesy, is rented at $12.25 a month. In the front room man and wife work at the bench from six in the morning till nine at night. They make a team, stripping the tobacco leaves together; then he makes the filler, and she rolls the wrapper on and finishes the cigar. For a thousand they receive $3.75, and can turn out together three thousand cigars a week . . . The workers in these tenements are just now on a strike, demanding $5.00 and $5.50 for their work . . .While we are in the house, the ultimatum of the “boss” is received. He will give $3.75 a thousand, not another cent.“

        <p data-uuid="207919b81cc44daaa090193738cd6e95">Overcrowding caused sanitation problems. Most cities did not have a good system for collecting trash, so garbage often piled up outside apartment buildings. An article in the <i>New York Tribune</i> described the garbage in front of one tenement as a “mass of air poisoning, death-breeding filth, reeking in the fierce sunshine.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="973ffa853c934a4aa04843243f6cb61c">Unsafe conditions were also common in tenements. Before 1900 most cities did not have laws requiring landlords to fix their tenements or to maintain safety standards. A fire on one floor could easily spread, and fire escapes were often blocked or broken. </p>
        <p data-uuid="76d7d2b5426346bbaffbf0ccfa643463">Tenement rooms had few or no windows to let in fresh air and sunshine. Comfort was also scarce, with so many people crowded into such small spaces. Running water and indoor plumbing were also scarce. So was clean water. Cities often dumped garbage into local rivers that were used for drinking water. </p>
        <p data-uuid="0a7b741de3d54823af641a2bf2bf5fe4">Disease-causing bacteria grew easily in these conditions. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid, influenza, and tuberculosis spread quickly in crowded neighborhoods. Children were the most vulnerable to these diseases. For example, babies born in Chicago in 1870 had only a 50 percent chance of living to the age of five. </p>

        <p data-uuid="94d1979b176348bd94e7f16d758db7a9">Air pollution was also a serious environmental problem in many growing cities. This was a time when many business leaders were building huge oil refineries, steel mills, and other factories. The steel mills of Andrew Carnegie, for example, helped make Pittsburgh the nation’s steel-making center in the late 1800s. Steel mills brought jobs and wealth to Pittsburgh. But they also caused some of the nation’s worst environmental issues. “Every street appears to end in a huge, black cloud,” said one writer. “Pittsburgh is smoke, smoke, smoke—everywhere smoke.” The air was so polluted at times that the city had to turn on outdoor lighting during the day.</p>

By the late 1800s new sewage and water purification systems improved city sanitation. Many major cities began hiring full-time firefighters and police officers. Police officers in cities were typically placed in one neighborhood. They knew the local residents and were frequently involved in local activities. They could spot local problems and, in many cases, provide help to immigrants.</p>
