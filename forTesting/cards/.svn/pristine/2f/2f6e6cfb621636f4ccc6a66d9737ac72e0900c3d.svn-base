        <p data-uuid="15ee72ef0f224f1688e4bde04113db20">Many significant
            events took place in Europe in the 1500s. Disagreements about religion threw
            Europe into turmoil. Some of these disagreements eventually led to wars. At the
            same time, several European nations began to compete for land and power
            overseas.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="8b6217e9c0164f29a1ef87f683ddce1d">The
            Protestant Reformation</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b44839514bfb427e84126b7cfbb0b1a7">In 1517 a German
            priest named Martin Luther publicly criticized the Roman Catholic Church.
            Luther charged that the church was too wealthy and that it abused its power.
            Criticisms like Luther’s started the <b><dfn title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant
            Reformation</dfn></b>. This religious movement began in small German towns but
            quickly spread to much of Europe. It became a part of many political disputes
            as well. The <b><dfn title="Protestants">Protestants</dfn></b> were
            reformers who protested some of the Catholic Church’s practices. Many
            Protestants believed God meant for religion to be simple.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ecf09819de14487b8bd6b51a1555dbfa">The printing press—a
            machine that produces printed copies using movable type—helped spread the ideas
            of the Reformation. Protestants printed large numbers of Bibles as well as
            short essays explaining their ideas. This allowed more people to read and think
            about the Bible on their own, rather than relying solely on the teachings of a
            priest.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9d69e639a40a4d6ca41ff36299dc2ad3">Conflicts between
            Catholics and Protestants took place throughout Europe, often leading to civil
            war. In the late 1500s French Catholics fought with French Protestants, known
            as Huguenots (<span class="smallcaps">HYOO</span>-guh-nahts). Many Huguenots eventually immigrated to the
            Americas in search of religious freedom.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9b7dffe8721441289bd96ef45e185268">
            In
            1534 King Henry VIII founded the Church of England, or the Anglican Church. By
            making himself the head of the church, Henry challenged the authority of the
            pope and angered Catholics. Political issues soon became entangled with the
            religious struggles.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="4b84c323523e4385a44c46d2e0686a04">Spain and England Go to War</h3>
        <p data-uuid="6c16076fe8a442bc88fa7b6d55b5c907">In the late 1500s
            King Philip II used Spain’s great wealth to lead a Catholic Reformation against
            the Protestant movement. He hoped to drive the Protestants out of England.
            Standing in his way was the Protestant English queen Elizabeth I and her sea
            dogs. Sea dogs was the name given to English sailors who raided Spanish
            treasure ships. The most successful and daring was Sir Francis Drake.</p>
        <p data-uuid="91c91c14a3dd4318a52d6f7a9770ff95">Philip was angered by
            English piracy. He began gathering the <b><dfn title="Spanish Armada">Spanish
            Armada</dfn></b>, a huge fleet of warships meant to end English plans. The Armada
            had about 130 ships and some 27,000 sailors and soldiers. This mighty fleet was
            launched to invade England and overthrow Queen Elizabeth and the Anglican
            Church. But in July 1588 the smaller, but faster, English fleet defeated the
            Armada in a huge battle.</p>
        <p data-uuid="234aeb1487ac4d1aa5226b465325f8f3">
            The
            Armada’s defeat shocked the Spanish. In addition to the naval defeat, Spain’s
            economy was in trouble. The gold and silver that Spain received from the
            Americas caused high inflation. Inflation is a rise in the&#160;price of goods
            caused by an increase in the amount of money in use. Economic problems in Spain
            combined with the defeat of the Spanish Armada led countries such as England,
            France, and the Netherlands to challenge Spanish power overseas.</p>
