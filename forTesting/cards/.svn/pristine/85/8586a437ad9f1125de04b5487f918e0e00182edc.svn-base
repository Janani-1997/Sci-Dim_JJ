        <p data-uuid="7b417dedea034237b30f5b8c4042be5a">Some Americans had opposed slavery since before the country was founded. Benjamin Franklin was the president of the first antislavery society in America, the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery. In the 1830s Americans took more organized action to support <dfn title="abolition">abolition</dfn>, or a complete end to slavery.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8d94a9551384404881006483496ca1c6">Abolitionists came from many different backgrounds and opposed slavery for various reasons. The Quakers were among the first groups to challenge slavery on religious grounds. <dfn title="Embree, Elihu">Elihu Embree</dfn>, the son of a Quaker minister, published the first newspapers in the country devoted to the abolitionist cause. One newspaper was called <i>The Emancipator</i>. Embree proclaimed that “freedom is the inalienable right of <i>all men</i>.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="6f7fa3341ccb4cafac6c0d5a58890f7f">Other religious leaders gave speeches and published pamphlets that moved many Americans to support abolition. In one of these, abolitionist Theodore Weld wrote that “everyman knows that slavery is a curse.” Other abolitionists referred to the Declaration of Independence. They reminded people that the American Revolution had been fought in the name of liberty.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5511b060b856494d9d3f9d7cb51708bc">Antislavery reformers did not always agree on the details, however. They differed over how much equality they thought African Americans should have. Some believed that African Americans should receive the same treatment as white Americans. In contrast, other abolitionists were against full political and social equality.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c1d050e50b494954aaae3cce51ba2f15"> Some abolitionists wanted to send freed African Americans to Africa to start new colonies. They thought that this would prevent conflicts between the races in the United States. In 1817 a minister named Robert Finley started the American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to establishing colonies of freed slaves in Africa. Five years later, the society founded the colony of Liberia on the west coast of Africa. About 12,000 African Americans eventually settled in Liberia. However, many abolitionists who once favored colonization later opposed it. Some African Americans also opposed it. David Walker was one such person. In his 1829 essay, “Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World,” Walker explained his opposition to colonization.<br />
