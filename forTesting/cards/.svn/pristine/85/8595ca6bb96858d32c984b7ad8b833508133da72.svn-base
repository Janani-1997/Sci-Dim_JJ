        <p data-uuid="92961f7d47ef4af481377da28297d6d7">Not all mill owners followed this system. <b><dfn title="Lowell, Francis Cabot">Francis Cabot Lowell</dfn></b>, an entrepreneur from New England, developed a very different approach. His ideas completely changed the textile industry in the Northeast.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cd5f2bd469234720bed87bf8b8236945">The <b><dfn title="Lowell system">Lowell system</dfn></b> was based on water-powered textile mills that employed young, unmarried women from local farms. The system included a loom that could both spin thread and weave cloth in the same mill. Lowell constructed boardinghouses for the women. Boardinghouse residents were given a room and meals along with their jobs.</p>
        <p data-uuid="33c8fc3282ec40259888e6b70719e689">With financial support from investors of the Boston Manufacturing Company, Lowell’s first textile mill opened in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1814. “From the first starting of the first power loom there was not . . . doubt about the success,” wrote one investor. In 1822 the company built a larger mill in a Massachusetts town later named Lowell. Visitors to Lowell were amazed by the clean factories and neatly kept boardinghouses as well as the new machinery.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bfc72dcbea2149638b91cf4ebdfbfc36">The young women working in the mills soon became known as Lowell girls. The mills paid them between $2 and $4 each week. The workers were required to pay $1.25 for room and board. These wages were much better than the wages women could earn per week in other available jobs, such as domestic work.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4949b0ea42d84bf3a66c2e889bb74504">Many young women came to Lowell from different parts of New England. They wanted the chance to earn money instead of working on the family farm. Working in the Lowell mills gave young women the opportunity to achieve economic independence. “I must of course have something of my own before many more years have passed over my head,” wrote one young woman. The typical Lowell girl worked at the mills for about four years.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ce06d672ba544ffca58179edf133edba">The Lowell system aimed to overcome the perception that factory workers had a lower social status. Unlike other factory workers, the Lowell girls were encouraged to use their free time to take classes and form women’s clubs. They even wrote their own magazine, the <i>Lowell Offering</i>. Lucy Larcom, who started working in the Lowell mills at age 11, later praised her fellow workers.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c0fb4f379b2847e683dee76dd7e3e19e">Mill life was hard, however. The workday was between 12 and 14 hours long, and daily life was carefully controlled. Ringing bells ordered workers to breakfast or lunch. Employees had to work harder and faster to keep up with new equipment. Cotton dust also began to cause health problems, such as chronic cough, for workers.</p>
