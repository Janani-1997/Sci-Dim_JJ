            <p data-uuid="0fc548d456644f60a80a53898ddd596a">The decades following the Civil War unleashed a
                new age of invention that would shape modern America. During this time, several
                powerful business leaders rose from humble beginnings. Through hard work and
                shrewd insight, they became the richest men in the world. Popular “from
                rags-to-riches” stories made it seem like any hard-working American could
                attain great wealth and success. Still, many workers struggled and joined
                unions to protect their interests.&#160;</p>

                late 1800s. Choose one of the following roles: inventor, big business owner, or
                union leader. Write a speech in which you appeal to the government to support a
                law or a policy that serves your needs. List some examples of what type of government support you need and how
                it will benefit both you and the country. Be sure to mention the needs of the
                other competing interest groups, but point out their flaws or why your needs
                are more important.</p>
