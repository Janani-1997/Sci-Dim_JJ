In 1810 Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin described some of the obstacles faced by potential factory owners in the United States.</p>

        <p data-uuid="46c5bc4191a648f3ad65c5d9d5e5b62e">Gallatin and others believed that few people would choose to work in a factory if they could own their own farm instead. In Great Britain, on the other hand, land was more scarce and more expensive than in the United States. As a result, fewer people were able to own farms. British factory workers generally were willing to work for lower wages than factory workers in the United States were.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d7c52577259a43e796a2ebc7fb08b098">Because British manufacturers had plenty of factory workers with technical skills, they could produce large amounts of goods less expensively than most American businesses could. As a result, they could charge lower prices for the goods. Lower British prices made it difficult for many American manufacturers to compete with British companies. This situation in turn discouraged American investors from spending the money needed to build new factories and machinery. As a result, only a few industries had found a place to compete in the American market economy. These included cotton goods, flour milling, weapons, and iron production.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5f911479eb8f4d96b6171f127f424019">These circumstances began to change around the time of the War of 1812. Since the 1790s, conflict and wars between European powers had interfered with U.S. trade. Some goods became scarce, as American consumers were no longer able to get all the manufactured goods they were used to buying from British and European manufacturers. Then, during the War of 1812, British ships blockaded eastern seaports, preventing foreign ships from delivering goods. Americans began to buy the items they needed from American manufacturers instead of from foreign suppliers. As profits for American factories grew, manufacturers began to spend more money expanding their factories. State banks and private investors began to lend money to manufacturers for their businesses.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dae892e13cbe46fe8d4c56a200e0b449">At the same time, many Americans began to realize that the United States had been relying too heavily on foreign goods. If the United States could not meet its own needs, it might be weak and open to attack. Former president Thomas Jefferson, who had once opposed manufacturing, changed his mind. He, too, realized that the United States was too dependent on imports.</p>

The streets were decorated and filled with merchants whose ships were loaded with goods. “With Peace and Commerce, America Prospers,” declared one display. Eager businesspeople prepared to lead the United States into a period of industrial and economic growth. These merchants and industrialists urged northern politicians to pass higher tariffs on foreign goods to protect American companies.</p>
