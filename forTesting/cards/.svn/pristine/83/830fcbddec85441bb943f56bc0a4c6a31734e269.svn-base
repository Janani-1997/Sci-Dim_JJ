        <p data-uuid="6de94ba2891b413699062ba0a09e2425">Many of the African Americans who came north in the Great Migration built a thriving community in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. This community became the center of the <b><dfn title="Harlem Renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</dfn></b>, a period of African American artistic accomplishment. Artists of the Harlem Renaissance celebrated the cultural traditions and the life experiences of African Americans. </p>
        <p data-uuid="ba0c3726a3c941b8a93169e8c11f0db3"> Harlem Renaissance writers included <b><dfn title="Hughes, Langston">Langston Hughes</dfn></b> and Claude McKay. Hughes produced poems, plays, and novels about African American life. His works often incorporated African American slang and jazz rhythms. McKay was a poet and activist. He spoke out against racial discrimination and called on African Americans to stand up against lynchings and other violence. Another important writer of the Harlem Renaissance was Zora Neale Hurston. Her novels, such as <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>, reflected the experiences of African American women.<br />

        <p data-uuid="fe46d7c3dd4f451d8667eb1e7a0669e5">Other Americans also wrote of their experiences living in the United States and in places around the world. Soon after he graduated from high school in Illinois, Ernest Hemingway volunteered as an ambulance driver in World War I. Hemingway called the war “the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery that had ever taken place on earth.” He began writing short stories and novels. Soon, he gained fame for his powerful and direct writing. Hemingway was among a group of young American writers who expressed disillusionment in the American society. They felt it denied them a voice in their own futures. Author Gertrude Stein called these writers “a lost generation.” Writers who criticized American society in the 1920s thus became known as the <b><dfn title="Lost Generation">Lost Generation</dfn></b>. </p>
        <p data-uuid="424b1c9cd4044fb8ba7a9574ffacacc7">Many members of the Lost Generation moved to Paris in the 1920s. They formed a community of <b><dfn title="expatriates">expatriates</dfn></b>—people who leave their home country to live elsewhere. Hemingway wrote about the expatriate community in his best-selling novel <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>. Another Lost Generation writer was F. Scott Fitzgerald, who wrote <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. His novel focused on what he saw as the loss of morality behind the seemingly fun and free-spirited times of the Jazz Age. Another writer of the time, Sinclair Lewis, became the first American to receive the Nobel Prize in literature. </p>

While teaching art at a college in Canyon, Texas, she would sometimes hike in Palo Duro Canyon, where she sketched scenes of amazing colors and rock formations. This was the start of a lifelong fascination with the beauty of the desert landscape. O’Keeffe lived much of her life in rural New Mexico, where many of her paintings were created. Animal bones, rocks, and desert flowers fill her works. She would often paint these objects in close-up view, showing tiny details. O’Keeffe said, “Most people in the city rush around so, they have no time to look at a flower. I want them to see it whether they want to or not.”</p>
