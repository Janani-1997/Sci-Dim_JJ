        <p data-uuid="9623a6597e27456ba258006b3124441e">Many Cherokee had believed that they could prevent conflicts and avoid removal by adopting the contemporary culture of white people. In the early 1800s they invited missionaries to set up schools where Cherokee children learned how to read and write in English. The Cherokee developed their own government modeled after the U.S. Constitution with an election system, a bicameral council, and a court system. All of these were headed by a principal chief.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c01c8a31a5354973a17e31e0dfc66389">A Cherokee named <b><dfn title="Sequoya">Sequoya</dfn></b> used 86 characters to represent Cherokee syllables to create a writing system for their own complex language. In 1828 his contribution led the Cherokee to begin publishing a newspaper printed in both English and Cherokee.</p>

            <p data-uuid="4365a5f1ef934099948d9535ec0c34be">Known as Sogwali to the Cherokee and George Guess to most Americans of his time, he was given the name Sequoya by missionaries. Sequoya was born in Tennessee but came to live in the Cherokee country in Georgia. He worked as a trader and also as a blacksmith and silversmith. In his work as a trader, Sequoya had many meetings with white Americans. He was curious about their way of communicating through writing. Although many Cherokee believed the writing to be a form of witchcraft, Sequoya saw the benefits of a written language.</p>
            <p data-uuid="276566b823fe415ea2b23ccef7749795">Sequoya’s first attempt at creating a written language was to invent a symbol for each spoken word. Sequoya soon realized this would create too many symbols. He began studying the sounds of the spoken Cherokee language. After a long time, he came up with 86 different syllables, or sound units, and created symbols for each syllable. </p>
            <p data-uuid="eafb986a98464d689affa4fe5f25c60f">Sequoya’s daughter became the first to read and write with the syllabary. A group of Cherokee warriors believed Sequoya and his daughter were dealing with a form of witchcraft. They were put on trial. After proving that the symbols represented the Cherokee language, Sequoya was asked to teach the symbols to the warriors. The warriors learned the written language within a week. The gift of literacy soon spread throughout the Cherokee Nation. Before long, newspapers were published in the Cherokee language.</p>
            <p data-uuid="0a14568229864418bff45512e1360441">Sequoya was moved west to Oklahoma with other Cherokee by the U.S. government. He continued teaching thousands of Cherokee to read and write. Having a written language helped unite the Cherokee people throughout the country and made them leaders among other Native Americans. </p>
            <p data-uuid="64f89bc313294690b665973875abc6c1">Sequoya died around 1843 but will always be remembered for his contributions to the Cherokee nation. The large sequoia trees of the western United States are named in his honor.<br />

        <p data-uuid="85aebfe7894d4bd3a164c40dbf40164e">The adoption of white culture did not protect the Cherokee. After gold was discovered on their land in Georgia, their treaty rights were ignored. Georgia leaders began preparing for the Cherokee’s removal. When they refused to move, the Georgia militia began attacking Cherokee towns. Instead of responding with force, the Cherokee fought in the American court, or judicial, system. They sued the federal government, claiming that they had sovereignty, or the right to be respected as a foreign country. The case, the <i>Cherokee Nation</i><i> </i>v.<i> </i><i>Georgia</i> reached the Supreme Court in 1831. Chief Justice John Marshall, however, refused to hear the case. He ruled that the Cherokee had no right to bring suit since they were neither citizens nor a foreign country. Rather, Marshall said, they were a "domestic, dependent nation," resembling a "ward to his guardian [the United States]."</p>
        <p data-uuid="1baf3cabb59a45dcbc051f94341aa038"> The Cherokee, however, had another plan of attack. Samuel Austin Worcester was a white man, a teacher, and a friend to the Cherokee. The state of Georgia, carrying out the Indian Removal Act, ordered Worcester to leave Cherokee land. He refused and brought suit on behalf of himself and the Cherokee. In the suit, the Cherokee said that they were an independent, or sovereign, nation and claimed that the government of Georgia had no legal power over their lands.</p>
        <p data-uuid="161db60a2c77453ba33cf2907f3c8593">In 1832 the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice John Marshall, agreed. In <i><dfn title="Worcester v. Georgia"><i>Worcester</i> v. <i>Georgia</i></dfn></i> the Court ruled that the Cherokee nation was a distinct community in which the laws of Georgia had no force. The Court also stated that only the federal government, not the states, had authority over Native Americans. </p>
        <p data-uuid="02aa6387207e403fad8c5c0a58d3642d">Georgia, however, ignored the Court’s ruling, and President Jackson’s response was to take no action to make Georgia follow the ruling. “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it,” Jackson supposedly said. By not enforcing the Court’s decision, Jackson violated his presidential oath to uphold the laws of the land. However, most members of Congress and American citizens did not protest the ways Jackson removed Native Americans. This contributed to the struggle between the Cherokee nation and the United States government. </p>

A few were able to escape and hide in the mountains of North Carolina. After the Cherokee were removed, Georgia took their businesses, farms, and property.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b9bbcc2dcc1d45e5a8ee033b18751d5b">The Cherokee’s 800-mile forced march became known as the <b><dfn title="Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</dfn></b>. During the march, the Cherokee suffered from disease, hunger, and exposure to harsh weather. Almost one-fourth of the 18,000 Cherokee died on the march.</p>
