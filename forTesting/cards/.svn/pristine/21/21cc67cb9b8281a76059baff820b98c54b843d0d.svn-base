        <p data-uuid="7df622bcafa94e3186cdcc82e404b327">As Bush began his presidency, Mikhail
            Gorbachev continued his reform programs in the Soviet Union. In the
            Soviet-controlled states of Eastern Europe, people demanded even faster change
            and more freedom. Pro-democracy movements in Hungary, Poland, and other nations
            put increasing pressure on Communist governments. This pressure produced
            world-changing results in 1989, as pro-Soviet governments across Eastern Europe
            began to fall.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9c2731f7c9814f9f9b6e45d3c8207c7f">
            In October 1989 massive protests in East Germany led to the resignation
            of Communist leader Erich Honecker. The new government agreed to open the
            borders of East Germany. This included the border guarded by the Berlin Wall.
            At midnight on November 9, a wild celebration broke out as East and West
            Berliners jumped onto the Berlin Wall, shouting and dancing. Some smashed
            through parts of the wall with hammers and chisels. The wall began crumbling to
            the ground. It had stood as a symbol of the Cold War since 1961. Within a year,
            the two Germanys reunited as one democratic country.<br />

            independence from the Soviet regime. Hard-line Communists were desperate to
            hold on to power. They took Gorbachev hostage in August 1991 and tried to seize
            the government. Thousands of Soviets took to the streets in protest. Ignoring
            orders to stop the protesters, many soldiers joined the crowds. Pro-democracy
            leader Boris Yeltsin encouraged the protesters to stand strong. Within a few
            months, Gorbachev resigned and the Soviet Union broke apart.<br />

            Russian president Yeltsin to improve relations between the United States and
            Russia. In February 1992 they issued a formal statement declaring an end to the
            Cold War. In 1991 Bush and Gorbachev had signed the START pact limiting nuclear
            weapons. Subsequently, in January 1993, Yeltsin and Bush signed a second treaty
            called START II. This treaty was supposed to further reduce the number of
            nuclear weapons, but it was never put into effect.</p>

            work together, especially during times of crisis. A major crisis soon developed
            in the Middle East. In August 1990 Iraq’s dictator, <b><dfn title="Hussein, Saddam">Saddam Hussein</dfn></b>, invaded neighboring oil-rich Kuwait.</p>
        <p data-uuid="38ec989123bb4e07baade93eddf86406">Members of the United Nations called for the

            from Kuwait by force.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ffd72bedf8c143228e6438cda0da5ad3">

        <p data-uuid="d142f14d99d549569fdcb500e392f7c7">Bush had campaigned on a firm pledge not to
            raise taxes. Once he was in office, however, he faced pressure due to the high
            federal deficit and a weakening economy. Bush proposed a plan to lower the
            deficit with spending cuts. The Democrats in Congress rejected his plan. In
            1990 he compromised by agreeing to tax increases, which angered many
            conservatives. This step did not prevent the economy from entering a recession.
            In the spring of 1992, the unemployment rate climbed above 7 percent—a six-year
            high. Americans began to think that Bush was good at foreign policy but
            ineffective at home.<br />
