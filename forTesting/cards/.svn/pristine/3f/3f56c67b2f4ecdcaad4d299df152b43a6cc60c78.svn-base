        <p data-uuid="87b914a1710e4e1285d106254af23303">Even though the Constitution was adopted by the Convention, delegates continued to debate about the power of state governments and the role of each branch of the national government. The framers of the Constitution knew that the document would cause controversy. At once, they began to campaign for ratification, or approval, of the Constitution.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7e6a773424d9488a8f64d843562cba53">The framers suspected that people might be afraid that the Constitution would take too much power away from the states. To address this fear, the framers explained that the Constitution was based on federalism. Linking themselves to the idea of federalism, the people who supported the Constitution took the name <b><dfn title="Federalists">Federalists</dfn></b>.</p>
        <p data-uuid="654138e7546b4df4bc4a911094739c57">The Federalists promoted their views and answered their critics in a series of essays known as the<i><b> </b></i><dfn title="Federalist Papers"><i>Federalist Papers</i></dfn>. They were published anonymously under the name <i>Publius</i>. Three well-known politicians actually wrote the<i> Federalist </i><i>Papers</i>—James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. These essays first appeared as letters in New York newspapers. Calling for ratification of the Constitution, the<i> Federalist </i><i>Papers</i> appealed both to reason and emotion.</p>

Some feared that a strong president might be declared king. Others feared the Senate might become a powerful ruling class. In either case, they thought, the liberties fought for during the Revolution might be lost.</p>

Large states and those with strong economies, such as New York, also were unsupportive of the Constitution at first.</p>
