        <p data-uuid="8ec0215bf9f848f9a657cd63059be48c">Popular fiction often made it seem that all white southerners had many slaves and lived on large plantations. Fiction writers wrote about wealthy southern families who had frequent, grand parties. The ideal image of the Antebellum (before the war) South included hospitality and well-treated slaves on beautiful plantations that almost ran themselves.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0b3fd3ee4ac247ba9c797b1f5373548c">This romantic view was far from the reality. During the first half of the 1800s, only about one-third of white southern families had slaves. Fewer families had plantations. Despite their small numbers, these planters had a powerful influence over the South. Many served as political leaders. They led a society made up of many different kinds of people, including yeoman farmers, poor whites, enslaved African Americans, and free African Americans. Each of these segments of society contributed to the economic success of the South.</p>

        <p data-uuid="01e53b8f2e8f422ea18db4b1465e0f5c">As the wealthiest members of southern society, planters also greatly influenced the economy. Some showed off their wealth by living in beautiful mansions. Many others chose to live more simply. A visitor described wealthy planter Alexander Stephens’s estate as “an old wooden house” surrounded by weeds. Some planters saved all of their money to buy more land and slaves.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f36b3a42bf034aa39aeaf1e67eb81325">Male planters were primarily concerned with raising crops and supervising slave laborers. They left the running of the plantation household to their wives. The planter’s wife oversaw the raising of the children and supervised the work of all slaves within the household. Slave women typically cooked, cleaned, and helped care for the planter’s children. Wives also took on the important social duties of the family. For example, many southern leaders discussed political issues at the dances and dinners hosted by their wives.</p>

        <p data-uuid="28c72fd8636f4caeba691486346355ff">Planters often arranged their children’s marriages based on business interests. Lucy Breckinridge, the daughter of a wealthy Virginia planter, was married by arrangement in 1865. Three years earlier, she had described in her journal how she dreaded the very thought of marriage. “A woman’s life after she is married, unless there is an immense amount of love, is nothing but suffering and hard work.” How Breckinridge’s life in her own arranged marriage would have turned out cannot be known. She died of typhoid fever just months after her wedding.<br />

        <p data-uuid="e1486edf674e4e7f952e10aee1bd32f4">Most white southerners were <b><dfn title="yeomen">yeomen</dfn></b>, owners of small farms. Yeomen owned few slaves or none at all. The typical farm averaged 100 acres. Yeomen took great pride in their work. In 1849 a young Georgia man wrote, “I desire above all things to be a ‘Farmer.’ It is the most honest, upright, and sure way of securing all the comforts of life.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="0c3ce5c06d524a23887670649030b21a">Yeoman families, including women and children, typically worked long days at a variety of tasks. Some yeomen held a few slaves but worked alongside them.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f4ffc60bfc764c1f8c6b7894a6eb60e9"> The poorest of white southerners lived on land that could not grow cash crops. They survived by hunting, fishing, raising small gardens, and doing odd jobs for money.</p>

[They] are commonly as immoral as they are ignorant; for as by the law of the States it is forbidden to teach the negro slaves to read and write, and in consequence there would be no support for schools, where half the population consists of slaves, and the country in consequence is thinly inhabited; therefore the <b><a href="[remark:98765ebd78fb48f1a8867990763f316d]"> indigent</a></b> white people in the country villages are without schools, and very nearly without any instruction at all. . . .</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="ca20d3d050874579a87c2bc7c9592d4f">Religion and Society</h3>
        <p data-uuid="38485e7bce6f4e0883ef1c8675140b24">Most white southerners shared similar religious beliefs. Because of the long distances between farms, families often saw their neighbors only at church events, such as revivals or socials. Rural women often played volunteer roles in their churches. Wealthy white southerners thought that their religion justified their position in society and the institution of slavery. They argued that God created some people, like themselves, to rule others. This belief conflicted with the belief of many northern Christians that God was against slavery.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="64c850f5fd584f5bbb92f171e24c582a">Urban Life</h3>
        <p data-uuid="0b90010bf5454ad6b551a5ce3f87219d">Many of the largest and most important cities in the South were strung along the Atlantic coast and had begun as shipping centers. Although fewer in number, the southern cities were similar to northern cities. City governments built public water systems and provided well-maintained streets. Public education was available in a few places. Wealthy residents occasionally gave large sums of money to charities, such as orphanages and public libraries. Southern urban leaders wanted their cities to appear as modern as possible.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f6f311c8c53b49ccb8b996e6aa293545">As on plantations, slaves did much of the work in southern cities. Slaves worked as domestic servants, in mills, in shipyards, and at skilled jobs. Many business leaders held slaves or hired them from nearby plantations.<br />
