            position in society. In 1963 a government commission reported that women had
            fewer job opportunities than men and were often paid less for the same work.
            President Kennedy responded by ordering an end to discrimination based on
            gender in civil service jobs. That same year Congress passed the Equal Pay Act.
            This act required many employers to pay men and women equal salaries for the
            same work. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination based on both
            gender and race.</p>

        <p data-uuid="af9c026c5f694cba8f678b24b168d4f9">Friedan became a leader of the modern women’s
            rights movement. In 1966 she helped found the <b><dfn title="National Organization for Women">National Organization for Women</dfn></b> (NOW) to fight for equal
            educational and career opportunities for women. Other women worked for change
            by running for and holding public office. In 1968 <b><dfn title="Chisholm, Shirley">Shirley Chisholm</dfn></b> was elected to represent a New York City
            district in the House of Representatives. She was the first African American
            woman elected to the U.S. Congress.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d7fd21bf238340a09ba70453972e906d">In the early 1970s NOW and other women’s
            rights activists supported and lobbied for an amendment to the Constitution.
            The <b><dfn title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</dfn></b>
            (ERA) would outlaw all discrimination based on sex. The ERA was approved by
            Congress in 1972.</p>
        <p data-uuid="07731cc3a23a47069d3477457fa80074">
            For
            an amendment to go into effect, it must be ratified by three-fourths of the
            states—or 38 out of 50 states. The ERA was ratified by 30 state legislatures by
            the end of 1973. But many opponents came forward to block the ERA. <b><dfn title="Schafly, Phyllis">Phyllis Schlafly</dfn></b>, a conservative
            activist, founded the group STOP ERA to prevent its ratification. Schlafly and
            her supporters argued that the ERA would hurt families by encouraging women to
            focus on careers rather than on motherhood. Such opposition weakened support
            for the ERA. In June 1982 the amendment fell three states short of
            ratification.<br />

            many of its goals. Women found new opportunities in education and the
            workplace. For example, women began attending many formerly all-male
            universities. Increasing numbers of women pursued careers in traditionally
            all-male fields such as law and medicine. Many women also won political office
            at all levels of government.<br />
