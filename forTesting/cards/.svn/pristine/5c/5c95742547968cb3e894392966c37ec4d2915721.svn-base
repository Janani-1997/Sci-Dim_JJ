        <p data-uuid="bf5de4e238384f7fb1041ae6b909d4ca">In his inaugural address, President Pierce expressed his hope that the slavery issue had been put to rest “and that no sectional . . . excitement may again threaten the durability [stability] of our institutions.” Less than a year later, however, a proposal to build a railroad to the West Coast helped revive the slavery controversy and opened a new period of sectional conflict.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="ce2c9e26a7054c45ad8367de7fdcafb2">Douglas and the Railroad</h3>
        <p data-uuid="6d7469db85cb474ba4277c43c146f7a2">Ever since entering Congress in the mid-1840s, <b><dfn title="Douglas, Stephen">Stephen Douglas</dfn></b> had supported the idea of building a railroad to the Pacific Ocean. Douglas favored a line running from Chicago. The first step toward building such a railroad would be organizing what remained of the Louisiana Purchase into a federal territory. The Missouri Compromise required that this land be free territory and eventually free states.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a305c480cb6c40508d31a1f34ab7ed0e">Southerners in Congress did not support Douglas’s plan, recommending a southern route for the railroad. Their preferred line ran from New Orleans, across Texas and New Mexico Territory, to southern California. Determined to have the railroad start in Chicago, Douglas asked a few key southern senators to support his plan. They agreed to do so if the new territory west of Missouri was opened to slavery.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e2f2266ebee04ea1adeb062c0c6efa68">Two New Territories</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b528e26cee0f407b9005797953760406">In January 1854 Douglas introduced what became the<b> <dfn title="Kansas-Nebraska Act">Kansas-Nebraska Act</dfn></b>, a plan that would divide the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase into two territories—Kansas and Nebraska—and allow the people in each territory to decide on the question of slavery. The act would eliminate the Missouri Compromise’s restriction on slavery north of the 36&#176;30&#180; line.</p>

        <p data-uuid="bdd9f55d559146a397c2c73bf83754e3">Antislavery northerners were outraged by the implications of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Some believed the proposal was part of a terrible plot to turn free territory into a “dreary region . . . inhabited by masters and slaves.” All across the North, citizens attended protest meetings and sent anti-Nebraska petitions to Congress.</p>
        <p data-uuid="492a059dc4534cd8bc08a2b5cd617153">Even so, with strong southern support—and with Douglas and President Pierce pressuring their fellow Democrats to vote for it—the measure passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law on May30, 1854. Lost amid all the controversy over the territorial bill was Douglas’s proposed railroad to the Pacific Ocean. Congress would not approve the construction of such a railroad until 1862.</p>

        <p data-uuid="aa884e9bbb1d4f89b8edf1044d6fe45d">Antislavery and pro-slavery groups rushed their supporters to Kansas. One of the people who spoke out strongly against slavery in Kansas was Senator Seward.</p>

        <p data-uuid="925b989304f541a7819e473c435fdf87">Elections for the Kansas territorial legislature were held in March 1855. Almost 5,000 pro-slavery voters crossed the border from Missouri, voted in Kansas, and then returned home. As a result, the new legislature had a huge pro-slavery majority. The members of the legislature passed strict laws that made it a crime to question slaveholders’ rights and said that those who helped fugitive slaves could be put to death. In protest, antislavery Kansans formed their own legislature 25 miles away in Topeka. President Pierce, however, only recognized the pro-slavery legislature.<br />
