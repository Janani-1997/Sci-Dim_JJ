        <p data-uuid="5048d66e568c48d19187ef6ce35c1a16">Hard work also lay ahead for members of the new government. The new federal government had to create policies and procedures that would determine the future of the country. As President Washington noted in a letter to James Madison, “The first of everything in our situation will serve to establish a precedent.” A <b><dfn title="precedent">precedent</dfn></b> is an action or decision that later serves as an example.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d4570a850fe0476e830ff24841a59adf">The First Congress created departments in the executive branch for different areas of national policy. Washington met with the department heads, or cabinet members, who advised him.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d3dfeac1dcc940479c7023722dda85ad">Today we know that presidents have cabinet meetings with their top advisers. This practice started during Washington’s presidency and was common by 1792.</p>

        <p data-uuid="a6834a1dc409440c8f009797fdd22ad0">For two of his most important cabinet positions, Washington chose carefully. He picked Alexander Hamilton as secretary of the treasury and Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state. Henry Knox served as secretary of war, and Samuel Osgood was chosen as postmaster general. Hamilton was a gifted economic planner, and Jefferson had served as ambassador to France. Knox had helped Washington run the Continental army, and Osgood had government experience.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d71709c484d841afa2d078dd8f3c3658">To set up the federal court system and the courts’ locations, Congress passed the <b><dfn title="Judiciary Act of 1789">Judiciary Act of 1789</dfn></b>. This act gave the Supreme Court six members: a chief justice, or judge, and five associate justices. Over time, that number has grown to nine. The president nominated candidates for federal judgeships. Those candidates then had to be approved or rejected by the Senate. For chief justice, Washington appointed John Jay, the prominent New York lawyer.</p>
