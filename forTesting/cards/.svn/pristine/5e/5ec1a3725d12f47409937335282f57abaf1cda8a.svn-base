        <p data-uuid="565fa68f266f4a4eb0068fc6d12defc7">Two historical events, the Great Awakening and the French and Indian War, helped unite colonists living in very different areas. In the 1730s and 1740s, a Christian religious movement called the <dfn title="Great Awakening">Great Awakening</dfn> swept the colonies. It drew people from all walks of life to hear sermons about spiritual equality and social issues.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="61ff2f968ea5491081969016bac01475">In 1754 the French and Indian War began, pitting the British colonists against French colonists and their Indian allies. The British won the war in 1763. This victory encouraged colonists to settle farther west.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="b16cbeeeb06a4e47878235c4d29f4b45">Road to War</h3>
        <p data-uuid="6f676e8cff6e414784516b767cce5f96">To pay for the war, Parliament passed new taxes on colonial goods such as sugar, paper products, and tea. Many colonists saw this as “taxation without representation,” because they had no officials representing them in Parliament. They responded by boycotting, or refusing to buy, British goods. Tensions rose. When British troops fired on a Boston mob in 1770, colonists were outraged. Colonists called the shootings the Boston Massacre. Paul Revere created an elaborate color print titled “The Bloody Massacre perpetrated in King Street.”<br />
