        <p data-uuid="aa86d07001f1490fbab108f34730e30f">Many colonists agreed with Paine. In April 1776 more than 90 percent of adult males in New Hampshire signed a document called the Association Test. Signers of this document swore to take up arms and resist British rule. Among the signers was Wentworth Cheswell, an African American teacher and government leader.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6d2724c1985d47b08725783f1bbeb7ae">In June 1776 the Second Continental Congress formed a committee to write a document declaring the colonies’ independence. A committee also created a seal for the new country with the Latin motto <i>“E pluribus unum”</i> or “out of many, one.” This motto recognized the new union of states.</p>

        <p data-uuid="699fa3bd15bc4ac0a06f76fc43cf3425"> The <b><dfn title="Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</dfn></b> formally announced the colonies’ break from Great Britain. In the Preamble, <b><dfn title="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</dfn></b>, the document’s main author, stated why the members of the Continental Congress believed the colonies had the right to become a free nation. The Declaration of Independence expressed three main ideas. First, Jefferson argued that all people possess unalienable rights, including the rights of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Jefferson’s eloquent argument reflected the English Bill of Rights of 1689 and the ideas of philosopher John Locke and English lawyer William Blackstone about natural rights.<br />

        <p data-uuid="0a86f959286b4bebad465fbeb8e7e104">Next, Jefferson asserted that King George III had violated the colonists’ rights by taxing them without their consent. Jefferson accused the king of passing unfair laws and interfering with colonial governments. Jefferson also believed that stationing a large British army within the colonies was a burden.</p>
        <p data-uuid="583c7227378c4ccda4c6a68cb71c04ff">Third, Jefferson stated that the colonies had the right to break from Britain. Influenced by the Enlightenment ideal of the social contract that came from philosophers such as John Locke, Jefferson maintained that governments and rulers must protect the rights of citizens. In exchange, the people agree to be governed. Jefferson argued that King George III had broken the social contract.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9984c1657dd5404ca21adb744d385a4d"> On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence. This act broke all ties to the British crown. The United States of America was born. Today, the key principles of the Declaration of Independence are part of the unifying ideas of American democracy.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="c73cd211abde45b6af1d59a1655a2a91">Choosing Sides</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f2064cffcffc484fa7afd1121ef2f3ab">The signing of the Declaration made the rebellion a full-scale revolt against Britain. Those who supported it would be considered traitors. Colonists who chose to side with the British were known as <b><dfn title="Loyalists">Loyalists</dfn></b>—often called Tories. Historians estimate that 40 to 45 percent of Americans were Patriots, while 20 to 30 percent were Loyalists. The rest were neutral. In every colony there were more Patriots than Loyalists.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6547b07f24764dba9f1c6ceeeb3b5ba0"> Because of persecution by Patriots, more than 50,000 Loyalists fled the colonies during the Revolution. Most went to Canada, where Britain allowed them more self-rule after the Revolution. In doing so, they abandoned their homes and property. Divided allegiances tore apart families and friendships—even Benjamin Franklin became separated from his Loyalist son William. Benjamin Franklin wrote about his political beliefs and his scientific experiments in his Autobiography, which was first published in 1791.<br />

                    <p class="source" data-uuid="be95d99ec74b44fdb19a3ddba299c62c">In a letter to his father, William Franklin expressed his opinion that all British laws governing the American colonies should be obeyed unless legal action was taken to repeal them. He also said it was the responsibility of executive members of government to enforce these laws. Benjamin Franklin had a very different opinion about the laws that the British Parliament made for the colonies.</p>

        <p data-uuid="aef5b7bc3a7540cb95916571f950bd86">Native Americans were at first encouraged by both sides to remain neutral. By the summer of 1776, however, both Patriots and the British were aggressively recruiting Indian fighters. Many Native Americans, particularly in the South, sided with the British because the British promised to give them guns and other European goods if they agreed to help them. In northern New York, four of the six Iroquois nations fought for the British. However, the Oneida and Tuscarora helped the Patriots, even delivering food to the soldiers at Valley Forge. Other Native American groups stayed out of the fighting.<br />
