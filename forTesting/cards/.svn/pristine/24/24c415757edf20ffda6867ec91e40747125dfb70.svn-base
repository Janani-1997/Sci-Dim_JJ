Where was everyone going to live? How were people going to get from home to work on crowded city streets? Several new technologies helped cities meet these challenges. These technologies forever changed the look and function of U.S. cities.<br />

        <p data-uuid="17c5560e1b764820838fce73e695aa1d">With so many people moving to urban areas, cities quickly ran out of building space in downtown areas. One solution would be to build taller buildings. Typical city buildings in the mid-1800s were only five stories tall, but taller structures were impossible to construct because the building materials available were either too weak or too heavy.</p>
        <p data-uuid="aff62e85bae04365aaae683a4b47621e">This changed with the rise of the American steel industry in the late 1800s. Mills began producing tons of strong and inexpensive steel. Soon, architects such as Louis Sullivan of Chicago began designing multistory buildings called skyscrapers. Architects used steel beams to make sturdy frames that could support the weight of tall buildings. This allowed builders to use limited city space more efficiently.</p>

        <p data-uuid="88fedca7aa144b2e857dd14fd37c2476">The safety elevator, patented by Elisha Otis in the 1850s, helped make skyscrapers practical. Previous elevators had been unsafe because they would crash to the ground if the elevator cable snapped. Otis’s safety elevator included a device to hold the elevator in place if the cable broke.</p>

        <p data-uuid="649ec01972754fc88f87ac3bd605c2e4">Taller buildings made it possible for more people to live and work in city centers. This increased the need for <b><dfn title="mass transit">mass transit</dfn></b>, or &#173;public transportation designed to move many people. By the late 1860s New York City had elevated trains running on tracks above the streets. Chicago followed in the 1890s.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c86bd207da414c4e99e35c0bb8ffeb6f">Some cities built underground railroads, known as subways. In 1897 the first subway in the United States opened in Boston. In 1904 the first line of the New York City subway system began operation. Cable cars and electric trolleys also became common. These streetcars cheaply and quickly carried people in the cities to and from work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9aac0e21fe47428d94d1966a5623714b">Many Americans who could afford it moved to <b><dfn title="suburb">suburbs</dfn></b>, residential neighborhoods outside of downtown areas that had begun springing up before the Civil War. Mass transit networks made such moves possible. People could live in the suburbs and take trolleys, subways, or trains into the cities.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="e1231eb955b04241a076b3f1e427d9df">New Ideas</h3>
        <p data-uuid="36738db0e0c143d39b403724428bcae8">In the late 1800s the United States also began to develop forms of <b><dfn title="mass culture">mass culture</dfn></b>, or leisure and cultural activities shared by many people. One factor contributing to mass culture was a boom in publishing. The invention of the Linotype, an automatic typesetting machine, greatly reduced the time and cost of printing. In 1850 there were fewer than 300 daily newspapers in the country. Because of the use of Linotype machines, by 1900 there were more than 2,000 newspapers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="764f067ac41546fbbc7ed078a17d481f"> Big cities often had many newspapers, so publishers had to compete for readers. In 1896 <b><dfn title="Pulitzer, Joseph">Joseph Pulitzer</dfn></b> added a color comic to his <i>New York World </i>newspaper. More people started buying Pulitzer’s paper. <b><dfn title="Hearst, William Randolph">William Randolph Hearst</dfn></b> was publisher of the <i>New York Journal</i>. He saw that comics helped sell newspapers. So he added a color comic strip to his paper. Soon, newspapers across the country were adding comic strips.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d5b9a1135c5d43d3b35e4d33a03375f8">Mass culture affected how people shopped as well. Giant retail shops, or <b><dfn title="department store">department stores</dfn></b>, appeared in some cities during the late 1800s. One of the earliest was Marshall Field in Chicago. Field’s offered low prices and large quantities of products. It also was the first department store to offer its customers a restaurant where they could eat while shopping. Newspaper and magazine advertising was used to bring in customers. Advertisers realized that women made most purchasing decisions about household goods, so they targeted their messages to them. The public was also attracted by fancy window displays.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f5c45965ede8481eaac4cb1b7512451f">Advertisers also tried new approaches to win customers. Food companies often used wholesome farm images to convey a sense of purity. Some companies came up with clever brand names, such as Uneeda Biscuit crackers, to help customers remember their products. </p>
        <p data-uuid="d16a9d49023940709dd1b82efa53de05">Rural dwellers did not have access to urban department stores. But they could purchase a huge variety of goods from mail-order companies. In 1897 Sears, Roebuck and Company produced a 507-page catalog. It offered everything from slippers to stoves to saddles. Mail-order customers simply made their selections, sent in their payments, and waited for the merchandise they ordered to arrive by rail or post.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5db73e154e9449bd92a8d99a84a6ae5f">World fairs were another example of mass culture. Fairs brought merchants together, which sometimes resulted in new ideas and products. At the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair, for example, a Syrian food vendor began making cones for a nearby ice cream vendor who had run out of dishes. Ice cream cones became popular throughout the country.</p>

The inexpensive entry tickets made Coney Island a favorite destination for children and families. For a nickel, visitors could ride a new invention called the Switchback Railway—the country’s first roller coaster.</p>
        <p data-uuid="01372b1cdeee4fb594830b9edeaf83d2"> As cities grew, people became aware of the need for open public space. Landscape architect <b><dfn title="Olmsted, Frederick Law">Frederick Law Olmsted</dfn></b> became nationally famous.

His plan intentionally placed a pond near busy streets, hoping that it would attract walkers. Olmsted reserved a special area of the park just for children. The Children’s District included a playground, open areas for playing and picnicking, and a dairy. Olmsted also included areas for horseback riding, ice skating, boating, and baseball, as well as a network of trails for roller skaters, walkers, and cyclists.<br />
