The <b><dfn title="Homestead Act">Homestead Act</dfn></b> gave government-owned land to small farmers. Any adult who was a U.S. citizen or planned to become one could receive 160 acres of land. In exchange, homesteaders promised to live on the land for five years. The <b><dfn title="Morrill Act">Morrill Act</dfn></b> granted more than 17 million acres of federal land to the states. The act required each state to sell this land and to use the money to build colleges to teach agriculture and engineering.<br />

        <p data-uuid="c322ec9fda4b4b43a1a2b2abf9ceaa36">In the late 1870s, large numbers of African Americans began to move west. Some fled the South because of violence and repression. The end of Reconstruction in 1877 led to harsh new segregation laws. Also, the withdrawal of federal troops left African Americans unprotected from attacks by such groups as the Ku Klux Klan. Others were inspired by Benjamin “Pap” Singleton, a former slave from Tennessee. He urged African Americans to leave the South and build their own communities in Kansas and elsewhere in the West. By 1879 some 20,000 southern African Americans had moved to Kansas. Many others settled in Missouri, Indiana, and Illinois. These African American migrants were known as <b><dfn title="Exodusters">Exodusters</dfn></b> because they had made a mass exodus, or departure, from the South.</p>

            <p data-uuid="211a26b7b3de4b959b69daa54a73acf5">Plains farmers had many unique challenges. The seasons were extreme. Weather could be unpredictable. Also, the root-filled sod, or dirt, beneath the Plains grass was very tough. The hard work of breaking up the sod earned Plains farmers the nickname <b><dfn title="sodbusters">sodbusters</dfn></b>. In the 1890s western Plains farmers began <b><dfn title="dry farming">dry farming</dfn></b>, a new method of farming that shifted the focus away from water-dependent crops such as corn. Instead, farmers grew more hardy crops such as red wheat. In addition, by the 1880s mechanical farming was becoming common. By using machinery, farmers could work much more quickly on large fields with fewer workers. Farmers shipped their harvest east by train. From there, crops were shipped overseas. The Great Plains soon became known as the breadbasket of the world.<br />

        <p data-uuid="1b6cc8ebd6a1426bb1c148439f8cf194">Women were an important force in the settlement of the frontier. They joined in the hard work of farming and ranching and helped build communities out of the widely spaced farms and small towns. They helped run their family’s farms and businesses. Many single women also moved to the Plains. Unlike single women in the East, they often owned their own property and ran their own businesses. Their role in founding communities facilitated a strong voice in public affairs. Wyoming women, for example, were granted the vote in the new state‘s constitution, which was approved in 1869. <b><dfn title="Bidwell, Annie">Annie Bidwell</dfn></b> one of the founders of Chico, California, used her influence to support a variety of moral and social causes such as women’s suffrage and temperance.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1e33900ff8774a61b3efdc26057811bc">Many early settlers found life on their remote farms to be extremely difficult. Farmers formed communities so that they could assist one another in times of need. One of the first things that many pioneer communities did was establish a local church and school. Children helped with many chores around the farm. Author Laura Ingalls Wilder was one of four children in a pioneer family. Wilder's books about settlers’ lives on the prairie are still popular today.<br />
