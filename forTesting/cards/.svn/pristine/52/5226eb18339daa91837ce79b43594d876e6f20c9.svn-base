        <p data-uuid="26fdca703bc2415c891b2db12ab0e2c7">The Transportation Revolution brought many changes to America. Steamboats and railroads made getting goods to distant markets much easier and less costly. People in all areas of the nation now had access to products made and grown far away. More than ever before, there was a national economy. The wealth, however, was centered in the North.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b6fdfbf3e2a3407ebd93ae964f5e621a">Railroads contributed to the expansion of the borders of the nation and guided population growth. Towns sprang up at railroad junctions as people migrated from rural areas. Those towns that did not have railroads nearby suffered and began to decline. Cities grew as trains brought new residents and raw materials for industry and construction. By linking previously isolated cities, towns, and settlements, the railroads promoted trade and interdependence. The growing prosperity of the nation, especially in the North, encouraged Americans to take pride in their country.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e1abc9a9e30c4487b867d55c5d7837d8">A New Fuel</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a03bdc24efce407f9142ff74b3c44ba1">The Transportation Revolution also increased the use of certain natural resources that had not been important until then. Throughout the early Transportation Revolution, wood was the primary source of fuel for trains and steamboats, as well as for cooking, light, and heat. As faster locomotives were built, new power resources were used to fuel them. Coal replaced wood as the main source of power. A half ton of coal produced as much energy as two tons of wood but at half the cost. Coal also became popular for heating homes. Railroads transported the coal from mines to towns and cities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e18dcdeff49e4975a1c3ec4b5ca50b43">As the demand for coal increased, a coal-mining industry developed in many states, including Pennsylvania, western Virginia, and Illinois. Coal mining changed the landscape in a number of ways. New towns, such as Coal City and Carbondale in Illinois, sprang up in places where coal deposits could be mined. Miners made deep gashes in the earth removing the coal.</p>

        <p data-uuid="cf9fb59576974742b8318ad62e5ab338">Later, in the 1870s, the demand for coal increased as the demand for steel grew. Many steel mills were built where there was an abundance of coal and iron ore. Steel is made through a smelting processâ€”heating iron ore to very high temperatures. Coal was used to fire the furnaces. Steel, which is much stronger than iron, was increasingly used to build factories and the machines they produced.</p>
        <p data-uuid="369e570ea1c740cf80e7c5760881033e">Cooperation among the steel and railroad industries helped the economy grow. Steel was used to make the rails that trains ride on and the growing market for steel helped fuel the need for more railroads. Railroads transported steel to places where new factories were being built. Railroads also brought new steel farming tools and machines to farmers in the Midwest. Using the new equipment, farmers produced more crops. Railroads then transported their harvests to markets.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="ecfcee1c56654442abcac6d0c29bc6c0">Effects of Railroads</h3>
        <p data-uuid="2cbee36d11e449a79992f0b2a7947cef">The development of railroads helped establish new markets and offered more opportunities for entrepreneurs to start their own businesses. The railroads also played a role in the growth of &#173;existing businesses. The logging industry expanded as people in the growing towns and cities needed wood for houses and furniture. As newspaper &#173;publishing increased, demand for paper grew. Lumber items became the primary product of New England. Sometimes there were unintended environmental consequences. Settlers spreading out across the Midwest cut down trees and plowed up prairies to make farmland. Deforestation, or cutting down and removing trees, took place on a large scale.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c9cd83fc7334449e8da299ff4c54894c">Railroads also caused cities to grow. Some cities became transportation hubs. Chicago was one such city. Its location on Lake Michigan made it an ideal transportation hub, linking the Midwest to the East and South.</p>
