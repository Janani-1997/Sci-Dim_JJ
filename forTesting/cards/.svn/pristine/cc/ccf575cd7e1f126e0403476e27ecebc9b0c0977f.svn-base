They came mainly from Great Britain, Germany, Ireland, and the countries of Scandinavia. Except for the Irish, who were Roman Catholics, most were Protestants. Many were skilled workers. Others settled in rural areas and became farmers. By the late 1800s immigrants from northern Europe were known as <b><dfn title="old immigrant">old immigrants</dfn></b>. A newer and larger wave of immigration—from different parts of the world—was arriving in the United States.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6f457d5371124c9dab00a34a6b6ac315">During the 1880s more than 5 million immigrants arrived in the United States—about the same number of people as had arrived during the six decades from 1800 to 1860 combined. The majority of these <dfn title="new immigrant">new immigrants</dfn> were from southern and eastern Europe. Thousands of Czechs, Greeks, Hungarians, Italians, Poles, Russians, and Slovaks came to the United States to find new opportunities and better lives. A young woman from Russia spoke for many of her fellow immigrants when she said she hoped “for all manner of miracles in a strange, wonderful land!”</p>
        <p data-uuid="ea0061ac02da4c26926b2b03d374a570"> New immigrants came from many different cultural and religious backgrounds. They included Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and Jews. Some were escaping political or religious persecution. They were eager for the job opportunities created by the U.S. industrial boom of the late 1800s.<br />

They moved from Russia to Boston in the 1890s to find religious freedom and to escape poverty. The Antin family had once been wealthy in Russia but had fallen into poverty due to illness. Antin’s father was the first to travel to the United States, where he worked for three years before bringing his wife and children from Russia. Here Antin describes her family’s arrival in America.</p>

The three small rooms into which my father now ushered us, up one flight of stairs, contained only the necessary beds, with lean mattresses; a few wooden chairs; a table or two; a mysterious iron structure, which later turned out to be a stove; a couple of unornamental kerosene lamps; and a scanty array of cooking-utensils and crockery. And yet we were all impressed with our new home and its furniture. . . . It was chiefly because these wooden chairs and tin pans were American chairs and pans that they shone glorious in our eyes. . . . Perhaps my mother alone, of us newcomers, appreciated the shabbiness of the little apartment, and realized that for her there was as yet no laying down of the burden of poverty.</p>

As we moved along in a little procession, I was delighted with the illumination of the streets. . . . People did not need to carry lanterns. In America, then, everything was free, as we had heard in Russia. Light was free; the streets were as bright as a synagogue on a holy day. Music was free; we had been serenaded, to our gaping delight, by a brass band of many pieces, soon after our installation on Union Place.

That subject my father had written about repeatedly, as comprising his chief hope for us children, the essence of American opportunity, the treasure that no thief could touch, not even misfortune or poverty. It was the one thing that he was able to promise us when he sent for us; surer, safer than bread or shelter.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="056c8c390aaf415eae739c1898128d3f">Immigrants usually faced a difficult journey by ship to America. Most traveled in steerage—an area below a ship’s deck where steering mechanisms were located. Steerage tickets were inexpensive, but the cabins were hot, cramped, and foul-smelling. Many passengers were seasick for the entire journey. Some even died of diseases contracted along the way.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ae2b97a310d2440a9a45413c0b2d038e">Once in the United States, new arrivals were processed through government-run immigration centers. The busiest center on the East Coast was Ellis Island, which opened in New York Harbor in 1892. The first immigrant processed through Ellis Island was Annie Moore Schayer, a 14-year-old from Ireland. Over the next 40 years, millions of European immigrants came through Ellis Island.</p>
        <p data-uuid="459f0825028e437683145b3ceb1c3b9c">At immigration centers, officials interviewed and examined immigrants to decide whether to let them enter the country. People with contagious diseases or legal problems could be turned away. “There was this terrible anxiety that one of us might be rejected,” remembered one immigrant traveling with his family. “And if one of us was, what would the rest of the family do?” This rarely happened, however. Fewer than 2 percent of the people who arrived at Ellis Island were not allowed into the country.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3ab60d2ecbc04eeaaf95703efc78698a">On the West Coast, many Chinese immigrants entered the United States through Angel Island, which opened near San Francisco in 1910. Because laws limited immigration from China, only people whose fathers were U.S. citizens were allowed into the country. Chinese immigrants were often kept at Angel Island for weeks or months while officials investigated their families.</p>
