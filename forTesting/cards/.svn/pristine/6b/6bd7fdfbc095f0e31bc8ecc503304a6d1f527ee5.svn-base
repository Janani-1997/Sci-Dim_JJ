In the late 1890s their newspapers published stories from Cuba, where Cuban rebels were fighting for independence from Spain. To attract readers, Pulitzer and Hearst printed sensational, often exaggerated, news stories. This technique is called <b><dfn title="yellow journalism">yellow journalism</dfn></b>. Vivid stories about Spanish brutality in Cuba convinced many Americans that the U.S. military should support the Cuban rebels.<br />

In 1896 William McKinley, a supporter of Cuban independence, was elected president. At first, he was against war, but American public opinion forced him to take action. Several events soon led to war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ef5123eedec34841a3650879d0742d9c">In February 1898 Hearst’s newspaper published a letter written by the Spanish minister to the United States, Enrique Dupuy de L&#244;me. In it, de L&#244;me called McKinley “weak and a bidder for the admiration of the crowd.” Many Americans were outraged.</p>
        <p data-uuid="77cf8eff74e34e09ae0c32a906cada94"> In January 1898, even before de L&#244;me’s letter became public, the United States sent the battleship USS <i>Maine</i> to Havana Harbor. Riots had broken out in Havana, the Cuban capital. The <i>Maine</i>’s mission was to protect U.S. citizens and economic interests in Cuba from the violence. On February 15 the <i>Maine</i> exploded and sank, with a loss of 266 men. Although the cause of the explosion was unclear, the American press immediately blamed Spain. “Remember the <i>Maine</i>!” became a rallying cry for angry Americans.<br />

        <p data-uuid="be792d2352fd4b75ae3ce80887d4b923">While attention was focused on Cuba, the U.S. Navy won a quick victory nearly halfway around the world in the Philippines, a Spanish colony in the Pacific. Filipinos, like Cubans, were rebelling against Spanish rule.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8e94b473b0f64ddd97a482796afce928">As soon as the Spanish-American War began, American commodore George Dewey raced to the Philippines with four large warships and two small gunboats. On May 1, ignoring reports that mines beneath the water barred his way, Dewey sailed into Manila Bay and destroyed the Spanish Pacific fleet stationed there. Dewey’s forces sank or captured ten ships. The Spanish lost 381 lives, but none of Dewey’s men were killed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9ee0ba0eb6c9436fb4f8dfd52b860318"> Dewey had defeated the Spanish, but he did not have enough troops to occupy and secure the Philippines. Troops eventually arrived, and on August 13, U.S. troops and Filipino rebels led by <b><dfn title="Aguinaldo (ahg-ee-NAHL-doh), Emilio">Emilio Aguinaldo</dfn></b> (ahg-ee-NAHL-doh) took control of the Philippine capital, Manila.<br />

        <p data-uuid="d9c587857c1b44f2b6eb3f773665ca34">In contrast to the navy, the U.S. Army was unprepared for war. At the start of the Spanish-American War, the entire U.S. Army had only 28,000 soldiers. New volunteers raised that figure to more than 280,000 within months. The army did not have enough rifles or bullets for these soldiers. It did not even have appropriate clothing for the troops. Many soldiers received warm woolen uniforms even though Cuba had a warm, tropical climate.<br />

They ate canned meat that one general called “embalmed beef.” Many were stricken with yellow fever and other deadly diseases. More than 2,000 Americans died from diseases they contracted in Cuba. Fewer than 400 were killed in battle.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9f4bbab4f4f24d8c81b908ccf5eaad99"> The most colorful group of U.S. soldiers was the 1st Volunteer Cavalry, nicknamed the Rough Riders. Second in command of this group was Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt had organized the Rough Riders to fight in Cuba. Volunteers included Native Americans, college athletes, cowboys, miners, and ranchers. Newspaper stories of their heroism earned the Rough Riders Americans’ admiration. Four privates of the African American 10th Cavalry, who served with the Rough Riders, received the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br />
