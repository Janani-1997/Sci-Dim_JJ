                in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve
                the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among
                the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of
                Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
                mankind requires that they should declare the causes which <a href="[remark:979c907c45bc4e94975bf3644dd1b69b]">impel</a> them to the separation.&#160;</p>
            <p data-uuid="5a0ae170d6f84e9b84d276a210763878">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
                men are created equal, that they are <a href="[remark:ace681fa9da445ec84da984bc0c4ff0b]">endowed</a>
                by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
                Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are
                instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
                governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these
                ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
                new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its
                powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety
                and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established
                should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all
                experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils
                are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
                are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and <a href="[remark:e9fcd1df8f8345c69f9a6f3c2b7b947c]">usurpations</a>, pursuing invariably the same Object <a href="[remark:9916bace64ee4059a0133c31dd13cf3f]">evinces </a>a design to reduce them under

                right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new
                Guards for their future security.—Such has been
                the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which
                constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the
                present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and
                usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute <a href="[remark:8cf8c395c6a142bd9b6e7085b0a7047c]">Tyranny </a>over these States. To prove

We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an<a href="[remark:fc438cad006e4fd6824b67aba3d27609]"> unwarrantable jurisdiction</a> over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and <a href="[remark:87e820eb55144947aae9f8763bfa864c]">magnanimity</a>, and we have <a href="[remark:5425d00561a046acaae7cb128c13f7af]">conjured </a>them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of <a href="[remark:11be50f4d81f480cb55d495d162e5e2a]">consanguinity</a>.

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>
