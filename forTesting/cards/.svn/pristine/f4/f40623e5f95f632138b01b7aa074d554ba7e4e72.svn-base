        <p data-uuid="162f614d70f943f6adfb3d9305774b5a">For centuries, the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee River valleys had been the hunting grounds of many Native American tribes. By 1800, however, thousands of white settlers had set up homesteads in these areas. The land had been opened up to settlement by an intrepid group of frontier guides known as long hunters. During months-long hunting trips, they explored and surveyed the wilderness west of the Appalachian Mountains. <dfn title="Boone, Daniel">Daniel Boone</dfn> was one of the most famous long hunters.</p>

            <p data-uuid="ebbfec8e9d1140deaed49e6576b31f84">Daniel Boone was born near Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1734. As a child, he enjoyed spending time outdoors. He quickly became a skilled hunter and trapper. In his teens, he began to use his skills to make a living. In 1755 he left home to fight in the French and Indian War. He used his survival skills to lead the British troops through the backwoods of Pennsylvania and later to escape a deadly ambush.</p>
            <p data-uuid="6e8862a21bb241a5baa1e3dffbbb8b3e">Many of Boone's accomplishments as an adult involved exploring the western frontier. In 1769 he set out with friends on an expedition to cross the Appalachian Mountains via the Cumberland Gap. Few white men had dared to travel so far west before. Then, in 1775 a friend hired Boone to lead a team of men to clear a path through the forest into Kentucky. Eventually this route became the Wilderness Road. Boone brought his family to live in the area, and other settlers followed. In 1799 Boone moved even farther west, into Upper Louisiana (present-day Missouri). Boone lived there until his death on September 26, 1820.</p>

        <p data-uuid="aa688233e9b34ccc991196be7022d424">In 1775 Boone and about 30 other long hunters cut a continuous road through the Cumberland Gap, a valley through the Appalachians. By the time it was finished, this Wilderness Road stretched some 300 miles. It soon became the main thoroughfare for settlers moving into the lands beyond the Appalachians. Some used a southern route called the <dfn title="Natchez Trace">Natchez Trace.</dfn> This was an old Native American trail that ran southwest all the way to the Mississippi River.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c7f4fa7c77304de69cc0dfae436078d5">As the region's population grew, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio were admitted to the Union. Settlers in these states depended upon the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to move their products to eastern markets. New Orleans, located at the mouth of the Mississippi, was a very important port. Its busy docks were filled with settlers' farm products and valuable furs bought from American Indians. Many of these cargoes were then sent to East Coast seaports—such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston—or to Europe. At the same time, manufactured goods passed through the port on their way upriver. As American dependence on the river grew, President Thomas Jefferson began to worry that a foreign power might shut down access to New Orleans.<br />
