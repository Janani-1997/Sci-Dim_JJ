        <p data-uuid="79eea858ee89418cbc3ff3c094901f61">At the start of the 1700s, the majority of people in Europe and the United States were farmers. They made most of what they needed by hand. For example, female family members usually made clothing. First, they used a spinning wheel to spin raw materials, such as cotton or wool, into thread. Then they used a hand loom to weave the thread into cloth.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5ae1b837a4634b2895c3d458043b8a05">Some families produced extra cloth to sell to merchants, who sold it for a profit. In towns, a few skilled craftspeople made goods by hand in their own shops. Workers including blacksmiths, carpenters, and shoemakers specialized in their work and the goods that they produced. Their ways of life had stayed the same for generations.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="d432597f12cb4d869668d3e95db71b59">A&#160;Need&#160;for&#160;Change</h3>
        <p data-uuid="8c8fee9f91d34fa18fa2b79c6a2448de">By the mid-1700s, however, changes in Great Britain led to a greater demand for manufactured goods. As agriculture and roads improved, cities and populations grew. Overseas trade also expanded. Traditional manufacturing methods did not produce enough goods to meet everyone’s needs. </p>
        <p data-uuid="37ffbf2bf5914de38718780b6ab8608d">People began using machines to create processes
            that made goods in more efficient ways. They also discovered new power
            resources to fuel the machines. These developments led to the <b><dfn title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</dfn></b>, a period
            of rapid growth in using machines for manufacturing and production that began
            in the mid-1700s.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4bbde93167a24acaaabbb565941998f3">Textile&#160;Industry</h3>
        <p data-uuid="29eb5f903e7c4d0e9127b222e87c9542">The first important breakthrough of the Industrial Revolution
            took place in how <b><dfn title="textile">textiles</dfn></b>,
            or cloth items, were made. Before the Industrial Revolution, spinning thread
            took much more time than making cloth. Several skilled workers were needed to
            spin enough thread to supply a single weaver.</p>
        <p data-uuid="655dab9ce52548748fbbb32ff1afe829">In 1769 British entrepreneur <b><dfn title="Arkwright, Richard">Richard Arkwright</dfn></b> invented a large spinning machine called a
            water frame. The water frame could produce dozens of cotton threads at the same
            time. It lowered the cost of cotton cloth and increased the speed of textile
            production.</p>
        <p data-uuid="aca0cf8b0c9e43ee83d6c3f16daf0c65">The water frame used flowing water as its source of power. Merchants began to build large textile mills, or factories, near rivers and streams. The mills were filled with spinning machines. Merchants began hiring people to work in the mills.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bdd3e07b486c4718b1ac7469bbbd567c">Additional improvements also speeded up the spinning process. Britain soon had the world’s most productive textile manufacturing industry.</p>
