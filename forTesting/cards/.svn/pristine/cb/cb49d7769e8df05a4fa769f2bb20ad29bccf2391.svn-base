        <p data-uuid="148c171cc42f451d968532101ddf2bb5">Once they entered the United States, immigrants began the hard work of adjusting to life in a new country. They needed to find homes and jobs. They had to learn a new language and get used to new customs. This was all part of building a new life.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="66289eb59d484ad891c8c45d14bfc049">Immigrant Neighborhoods</h3>
        <p data-uuid="12e8373d967a4251852a30a834649b06">Many immigrants moved into neighborhoods with others from the same country. In these neighborhoods, they could speak their native language and eat foods that reminded them of home. Immigrants could also practice the customs that their families had passed down from generation to generation. An Italian immigrant remembered that in his new neighborhood, “cheeses from Italy, sausage, salamis were all hanging in the window.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="27a5bad30d2344c5804516ceb965e431">In their newly adopted neighborhoods, many immigrant groups published newspapers in their own languages. They founded schools, clubs, and places of worship to help preserve their customs. In New York City, for example, Jewish immigrants founded a theater that gave performances in Yiddish—the language spoken by Jews from central and eastern Europe.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bd4ea04558a5495e8bbe487ef34336d4"> Immigrants often opened local shops and small neighborhood banks. Business owners helped new arrivals by offering credit and giving small loans. Such aid was important for newcomers because there were few commercial banks in immigrant neighborhoods. In 1904 Italian immigrant Amadeo Peter Giannini started the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. This bank later grew and became the Bank of America.<br />

        <p data-uuid="c6bed45b6a834f6da5997072804d5558">Some immigrant communities formed <dfn title="benevolent society">benevolent societies</dfn>. These aid organizations offered immigrants help in cases of sickness, unemployment, or death. At that time, few national government agencies provided such aid.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f1fffc6896724ae2be2163b27aab9428">Even with neighborhood support, however, immigrants often found city life difficult. Many immigrants lived in <dfn title="tenements">tenements</dfn>. These were poorly built, overcrowded apartment buildings. Lacking adequate light, ventilation, and sanitation, tenements were very unhealthy places to live. Disease spread rapidly in the crowded conditions.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3f847666ff55427c8bd05ebe1a772527">The plight of tenement dwellers sparked preliminary efforts at reform. In some cities, local boards of health were established to set sanitation rules. Enforcement was often uneven, however, and the poorer neighborhoods received less attention than richer ones. </p>
        <p data-uuid="7f7d3e1ec0f0425e81d5ed86bb64c4b7">Immigrants worked hard to adjust to their new country. Children often learned American customs more quickly than their parents. In public schools, immigrant children learned English from <i>McGuffey’s Readers</i>. The Readers were illustrated textbooks that taught reading and writing.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9b9073d887064f1dbb92555499c2d490">Many new immigrants had worked on farms in their homelands. Few could afford to buy land in the United States, however. Instead, they found jobs in cities, where most of the country’s manufacturing took place.<br />

        <p data-uuid="1865f7b7126348c7894ec67124635224">Having come from rural areas, few new immigrants were skilled in modern manufacturing or industrial work. They often had no choice but to take low-paying, unskilled jobs. They often worked in garment factories, steel mills, or construction. Long hours were common.</p>
        <p data-uuid="472a8e5f58844c3f9c8745493c01b5f6"> Not all industrial labor took place in large factories. Some immigrants worked for little pay in small shops or mills located in their own neighborhoods. Often associated with the clothing industry, these workplaces were called sweatshops because of long hours and hot, unhealthy working conditions. One young immigrant worker remembered:<br />

Some worked as bakers, carpenters, masons, or skilled machinists. Others saved or borrowed money to open small businesses such as laundries, barbershops, or street vending carts. New immigrants often opened the same types of businesses in which other immigrants from the same country were already succeeding. They worked hard for long hours to become successful themselves.</p>
