        <h3 data-uuid="ab606283ccf54875b87a206e742635b3">The Fugitive Slave Act</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b878e615b54e4972b505f755f3c7dd47">The <dfn title="Fugitive Slave Act">Fugitive Slave Act</dfn> made it a crime to help runaway slaves and allowed officials to arrest those slaves in free areas. People accused of being escaped slaves had to prove that they were not, which was often difficult or impossible. Also, escaped slaves who had lived in the North for years were returned to slavery if caught.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d683dff3c5f54d83af853a667bfa6d27">The law was openly resisted by people in the North. Many northerners who had previously been quiet on slavery issues were now furious. Mobs rescued enslaved people from northern police stations. They threatened slave catchers. In 1854 <dfn title="Burns, Anthony">Anthony Burns</dfn>, a fugitive slave from Virginia, was arrested in Boston. Abolitionists used force while trying to rescue him from jail, killing a deputy marshal. A federal ship was ordered to return Burns to Virginia after his trial. Many people in the North, particularly in Massachusetts, were outraged. </p>
        <p data-uuid="187e4a7ef75d4099937021216902257c"> The event persuaded many to join the abolitionist cause. At the same time, angered by these reactions of the northerners, some southern leaders began again to talk of seceding from the Union.</p>

        <p data-uuid="447a5b0fe5b04fb08e9a4ff24eb39790">Abolitionists in the North used the stories of fugitive slaves like Anthony Burns to gain sympathy for their cause. These slave narratives also educated people about their hardships.</p>

There she heard tales of slavery’s cruelty and  horror. Angered by the Fugitive Slave Act, she wrote a series of short stories about slave life for an antislavery newspaper in 1851. A year later, these stories were published as an antislavery novel entitled <b><dfn title="Uncle Tom’s Cabin"><i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i></dfn></b>.<br />

        <p data-uuid="506ebdf137194a62bb3954c21fb7c8e5">Although Stowe had little firsthand knowledge of slavery or the South, her novel became an enormous success, selling more than 2 million copies around the United States. Its popularity caused one northerner to claim that the book had created “two millions of abolitionists.” However, the book outraged many southerners. They accused Stowe of writing lies about plantation life. <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin </i>raised tensions over slavery to new heights.</p>
