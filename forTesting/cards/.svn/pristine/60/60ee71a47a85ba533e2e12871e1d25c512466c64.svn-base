As jobs and wages increased, so did people’s ability to buy new products. Some of these products as well as developments in factory and labor productivity and transportation changed the way Americans lived. Their standard of living also changed.<br />

        <p data-uuid="5e9a6d6bd3cc4650907ef66e87a99415">Henry Ford, an inventor and business leader from Detroit, wanted to build a car for all Americans. He achieved his goal by building a sturdy and reliable car called the <dfn title="Model T">Model T</dfn>, nicknamed the Tin Lizzie. In 1908 the Model T sold for $850. By 1925 it cost just $290. Ford was able to make his car affordable by cutting costs of production. For example, every car looked the same. The Model T came only in black for many years.<br />

        <p data-uuid="fb769c2948854d9087d3d49504f6a196">In 1914 Ford raised the wages for his factory workers to $5 a day. This was good pay, compared with the $2 or $3 per day offered by many other factories. Ford believed the wage increase would keep his employees from quitting. He also shortened the workday to eight hours and employed people that other factories would not hire, such as African Americans and people with disabilities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="94e0a4c77b3942358e65609f562c5bca">Even with the good wages, many workers had a hard time adjusting to the fast-paced and repetitive work on Ford’s assembly line. One wife of an autoworker wrote to Ford saying, “My husband has come home and thrown himself down and won’t eat his supper—so done out [tired]! . . . That $5 a day is a blessing—a bigger one than you know, but oh they earn it.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="f3e89ebc084a46f5ac3f6f9e4d75d396"> Ford wanted to help make his cars more affordable. He allowed customers to buy cars using an installment plan. Most people were used to saving up for years to buy items. Installment plans let people pay a small amount of the cost every month until the entire car was paid for. Ford’s competitors also allowed customers to pay with installment plans. For a slightly higher price than the Model T, companies such as General Motors offered cars in a variety of colors and with more power.<br />

With this advancement in transportation, they could now go on long drives or take jobs farther away from where they lived. Cars gave people a sense of freedom and adventure.

They made steel for car bodies, rubber for tires, or glass for windows. The government spent millions of dollars to improve road safety. The government hired workers to pave highways and build new bridges. People opened roadside businesses such as gas stations, restaurants, and motels to serve travelers. The rising number of cars also created a demand for car repair shops and car insurance.<br />

They began using assembly lines and allowing customers to pay on installment plans. Many companies also took advantage of the increasing number of homes with electricity. By 1929 about 85 percent of all Americans living in towns or cities had electricity. Companies responded by building new electrical appliances designed to make household chores easier. These companies made appliances such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bc7814aea68d4056bad808613ded9fb8"> As companies competed to sell these new goods, the advertising industry boomed. Companies advertised in magazines and on the radio to convince people that their lives would be improved if they owned a certain product. Many advertisers targeted women. They hoped to convince women that they needed the newest technological labor-saving products. For example, one advertisement for an electric dishwasher called its product “the greatest gift of electricity to the modern housewife.”<br />
