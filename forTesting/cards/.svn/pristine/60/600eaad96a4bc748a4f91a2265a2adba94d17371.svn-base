        <p data-uuid="cb50a91cb07f427498c488e277d030ce">In 1947 a civil rights group called the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) began protests in which African Americans rode in the whites-only section of interstate buses. In 1960 the Court ruled that segregation of bus stations was illegal. CORE decided to put pressure on President Kennedy to enforce this ruling.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2b73239f321f479aa9fc735e6130d363">To accomplish this, CORE organized a series of protests called the <b><dfn title="Freedom Rides">Freedom Rides</dfn></b>.<b> </b>On these rides black and white bus riders traveled together to segregated bus stations in the South. White riders planned to use facilities set aside for African Americans in bus stations. Black riders would use whites-only facilities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="88d28d2de3a54ac3991f76158331c575"> The Freedom Rides began in May 1961, when 13 riders boarded a bus traveling from Washington, DC, to New Orleans, Louisiana. In one Alabama town, the riders were viciously attacked by a white mob. After more attacks, CORE leaders decided to stop the protest to protect the riders’ lives.<br />

Arriving in Montgomery, Alabama, in late May, they were attacked by a furious mob. Many Freedom Riders were jailed in Jackson, Mississippi. That same month, President Kennedy ordered the Interstate Commerce Commission to enforce strict bans on segregation in interstate bus terminals.<br />

        <p data-uuid="939e951eb5ea4048abbf93c13dfb28f6">In 1963 Martin Luther King Jr. organized marches in Birmingham, Alabama. King was arrested and jailed for marching without a permit. While jailed, he wrote a “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” explaining his commitment to nonviolence. “We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom.” This commitment to using nonviolence in his fight for civil rights in the United States led to King being awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.<br />

Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue. Violence ends up defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.”<br />
