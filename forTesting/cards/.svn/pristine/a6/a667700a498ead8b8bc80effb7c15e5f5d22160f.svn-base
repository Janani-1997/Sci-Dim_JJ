        <p data-uuid="d70a89bae2c943c7868249a143a7b483">Despite their differences, Native American groups of North America shared a number of similar beliefs and practices. For example, Native Americans held similar spiritual and religious ideas. One was a spiritual connection to the natural world. A chief of a Wabanaki nation in the Northeast once described this idea by saying “The Great Spirit is our father, but the Earth is our mother.” </p>
        <p data-uuid="7eab6f8a18564c3f877af9d7792c52bb">In many belief systems, a tree stood at the center of the earth. For the Iroquois it was a white pine; for the Sioux, a mighty flowering tree. Animals, too, were thought to be powerful spirits. Hunters often carried out rituals to honor the spirit of an animal they were about to kill. Many groups chose an animal as their symbol and spirit guide.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1c048d081c694748937a2b253837cec0"> Native Americans also had similar ideas about land ownership. Generally speaking, they did not believe that land could be bought, sold, or owned by individuals. Rather, land was held for the use of everyone in a group to hunt, fish, or gather and grow food as needed. Many believed that they should preserve the land and its resources for future generations. These beliefs contrasted sharply with those of Europeans, who believed that land and everything on it could be bought and owned by individuals. This difference would cause conflict for hundreds of years.</p>

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="f8bdf08d61c948aeacc92f0d1619f0bc"> Individual Native Americans did not own land, but they did have other forms of private property. For example, in the Great Plains, women owned tepees and most of the household goods inside of them. </p>

        <p data-uuid="f994274969bf479c8c8af8c999821824">Among all the peoples of North America, women played essential roles in the groups’ survival. Women performed many tasks, such as making baskets and clothing, cooking, hunting, child rearing, and gathering wild foods. In the Great Plains culture area, women selected camp sites, crafted tepee covers from buffalo hides, and moved them to new locations. Among the Inuit, women had to prepare meat obtained on a hunt before the cold air froze the meat. In farming societies, women were usually responsible for growing crops. </p>
        <p data-uuid="00f2832edcaf4f33bd216a5815a865ec">In many North American groups, women owned property in their own right and held considerable decision-making power. For example, Iroquois clanmothers—older, respected women of the community—appointed chiefs. Clanmothers could also fire a chief if he proved to be a poor leader.</p>

        <p data-uuid="60112b886e6640569d763ec648dd00de">Though they held similar traits in common, the diverse culture groups of North America generally did not join together into large political units. For most Native American peoples, respected elders and chiefs led local groups. </p>
        <p data-uuid="967bcd9a54df48b6a5d81ebeab547498">Native Americans were, however, connected by thousands of miles of trade networks. Along with foodstuffs, raw materials, and exotic goods, trade networks carried ideas from place to place. One of the most famous routes began in Iroquois country and ran southward through mountain valleys to present-day North Carolina. It crossed the territory of the Shawnee, Choctaw, Cherokee, and other nations.</p>
