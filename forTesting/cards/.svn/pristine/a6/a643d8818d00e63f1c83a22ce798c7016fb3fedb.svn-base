        <p data-uuid="901360db1e2c40a8a20a33dbfd183f1f">By early 1856 Kansas had two opposing governments, and the population was angry. Settlers had moved to Kansas to homestead in peace, but the controversy over slavery began to affect everyone.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7169523fb99740a1b595150d08155c5b">In April 1856 a congressional committee arrived in Kansas to decide which government was legitimate. Although committee members declared the election of the pro-slavery legislature to be unfair, the federal government did not agree.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="c820eb1015cc4d22a52550217d51b5f6">Attack on Lawrence</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a3524631a0b14c8ba3fd6e69cebb191e">The new pro-slavery settlers owned guns, and antislavery settlers received weapons shipments from friends in the East. Then, violence broke out. In May 1856 a pro-slavery grand jury in Kansas charged leaders of the antislavery government with treason. About 800 men rode to the city of Lawrence to arrest the antislavery leaders, but they had fled. The posse took its anger out on Lawrence by setting fires, looting buildings, and destroying presses used to print antislavery newspapers. One man was killed in the pro-slavery attack that became known as the Sack of Lawrence.</p>

                    <p class="source" data-uuid="72d540db517b407aa2763e67d989f735">Dr. John Doy was an abolitionist who lived in Lawrence, Kansas. On January 25, 1859, he was captured while trying to lead escaped slaves to safety. A jury in Missouri sentenced him to five years in prison. The sentence outraged many citizens of Lawrence. A group of ten abolitionists decided to undertake a daring rescue operation. They succeeded in freeing Doy on July 23. Soon after, Doy and his rescuers posed for this photograph.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d43713f846dd45fca165e765044871ec">Abolitionist John Brown was from New England, but he and some of his sons had moved to Kansas in 1855. The Sack of Lawrence made him determined to “fight fire with fire” and to “strike terror in the hearts of the pro-slavery people.” On the night of May 24, 1856, along Pottawatomie Creek, Brown and his men killed five pro-slavery men in Kansas in what became known as the <b><dfn title="Pottawatomie Massacre">Pottawatomie Massacre</dfn></b>. Brown and his men dragged the pro-slavery men out of their cabins and killed them with swords. The abolitionist band managed to escape capture. Brown declared that his actions had been ordered by God.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e187ea64c8aa44458d02c5d02efca3a2"> Kansas collapsed into civil war, and about 200 people were killed. The events in “Bleeding Kansas” became national front-page news stories. In September 1856 a new territorial governor arrived and began to restore order.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="7acfe9501bcf4db3a1cf82440c240a09">Brooks Attacks Sumner</h3>
        <p data-uuid="ac63ec7756c347dfb8495cb7e0f52ec3">Congress also reacted to the violence of the Sack of Lawrence. Senator <b><dfn title="Sumner, Charles">Charles Sumner</dfn></b> of Massachusetts criticized pro-slavery people in Kansas and personally insulted Andrew Pickens Butler, a pro-slavery senator from South Carolina. Representative <b><dfn title="Brooks, Preston">Preston Brooks</dfn></b>, a relative of Butler’s, responded strongly.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8793d462cb534012a27faf60e78ea131">On May 22, 1856, Brooks used a walking cane to beat Sumner unconscious in the Senate chambers. Dozens of southerners sent Brooks new canes, but northerners were outraged and called the attacker “Bully Brooks.” Brooks only had to pay a $300 fine to the federal court. It took Sumner three years before he was well enough to return to the Senate.</p>
