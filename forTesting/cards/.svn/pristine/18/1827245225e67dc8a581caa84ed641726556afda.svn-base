        <p data-uuid="e645ff390e874929843552f46f21fe21">By the 1870s many Native Americans lived on reservations, where land was usually not useful for farming or buffalo hunting. Many Indians were starving. A Paiute Indian named Wovoka began a religious movement, the <dfn title="Ghost Dance">Ghost Dance</dfn>, that predicted the arrival of paradise for Native Americans. In this paradise, the buffalo herds would return and the settlers would disappear.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="8bf0821628b24563af25e1adf60f2245">U.S. officials did not understand the meaning of the Ghost Dance. They feared it would lead to rebellion, so they tried to end the movement, which had spread to other groups, including the Sioux. After the massacre in 1890 at Wounded Knee, the Ghost Dance movement gradually died out.</p>

            language. The <dfn title="Dawes General Allotment Act">Dawes General Allotment Act</dfn> of 1887 tried to lessen traditional influences on Indian society by making land ownership
            private for male-headed households rather than shared communally. The act also promised—but failed to deliver—U.S. citizenship to Native Americans. After breaking up reservation land, the government sold the acreage remaining. The Act took about two-thirds of Indian land.</p>

The children were dressed in European-style clothes, learned English, and often spent part of the day farming or doing other work. They were discouraged from practicing their own culture or speaking their own language. Many were separated from their families for years at a time.<br />
