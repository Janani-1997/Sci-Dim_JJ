        <p data-uuid="b7b59c7c716b4362a2b43fb63fa721da">Theodore Roosevelt hoped that his secretary of war, <b><dfn title="Taft, William Howard">William Howard Taft</dfn></b>, would take his place as president in 1908. Like Roosevelt, Taft favored business regulation and opposed socialism. With Roosevelt’s assistance, Taft defeated William Jennings Bryan in the election of 1908.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="668133f3780949fab82fe24f27c9f95e">Taft Angers Progressives</h3>
        <p data-uuid="8e8466f4958142b98ab2497086b6efbc">Despite their friendship, Roosevelt and Taft held different ideas about how a president should act. Taft thought Roosevelt had claimed more power than was constitutional.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dc5fc66361b74b2a855c829ed36acf7a">As president, therefore, Taft moved cautiously with reform and regulation. This upset Roosevelt and various Progressives, who supported stricter regulation of big business. Taft’s administration started twice as many antitrust lawsuits as Roosevelt’s had. But Progressives were not satisfied.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0031333817f04c5b933bb8ab6c92db65">Taft angered Progressives further by signing the Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909. This tariff reduced some rates on imported goods, but it raised others. Progressives wanted all tariffs to be lowered in order to lower prices for consumers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ec482fca24444c27804fd6dc6200b0f5"> Furious with Taft, Roosevelt decided to run for president again in 1912. After Taft won the Republican nomination, Roosevelt and his followers formed the <b><dfn title="Progressive Party">Progressive Party</dfn></b>. It was nicknamed the Bull Moose Party because Roosevelt said he was “as strong as a bull moose.” The split between Taft and Roosevelt divided the Republican vote, and Democratic candidate <b><dfn title="Wilson, Woodrow">Woodrow Wilson</dfn></b> won the electoral vote by a wide margin. Taft made the poorest showing of any president seeking reelection. Wilson won with only about 42 percent of the popular vote.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f79d442ab67c4523a7793600415c8c75">In his inaugural address, Wilson spoke of the terrible social conditions of many working-class Americans. He said that it was not enough to applaud the country’s industrial achievements, but Americans must attend to the needs of the workers. Passing reform legislation was Wilson’s top goal. He pushed for two measures soon after taking office: tariff revision and banking reform.<br />

With riches has come inexcusable waste. We have squandered a great part of what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent, scorning to be careful, shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient. We have been proud of our industrial achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human cost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and broken, the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through. The groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears, the solemn, moving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines and factories, and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat. With the great Government went many deep secret things which we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes. The great Government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="a6db94ef40dc439e81394d277f27c443">Wilson backed the Underwood Tariff Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs. The act also introduced a version of the modern income tax. The new tax was made possible in 1913 by the ratification of the <b><dfn title="Sixteenth Amendment">Sixteenth Amendment</dfn></b>. This amendment allows the federal government to impose direct taxes on citizens’ incomes.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d42b5af35e8643ac957f2e356d712a81"> President Wilson next addressed banking reform. The 1913 Federal Reserve Act created the modern banking system. The Federal Reserve Board (the “Fed”) oversees 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. It makes sure that money is distributed where it is most needed. These are bankers’ banks that serve consumer banks. The Federal Reserve Act created a more flexible currency system by allowing consumer banks to have more control over the money supply. To raise money, the Fed lowers the interest rate that it charges member banks. These banks then borrow more from the Fed and thus have more money to lend to people and businesses.</p>
