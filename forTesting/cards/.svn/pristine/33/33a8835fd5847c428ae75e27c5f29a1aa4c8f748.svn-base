        <h3 data-uuid="48d3f751766e4cf69fae211eb87759c9">Volunteer Armies</h3>
        <p data-uuid="aa9405f0541442e2abff5021b9295b83">Volunteer militias had sparked the revolution that created the United States. Now they would battle for its future. At the start of the war, the Union army had only 16,000 soldiers. Within months, that number had swelled to a half million soldiers. Southern men rose up to defend their land and their ways of life. Virginian Thomas Webber came to fight “against the invading foe [enemy] who now pollute the sacred soil of my beloved native state.” When Union soldiers asked one captured rebel why he was fighting, he replied, “I’m fighting because you’re down here.”</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4f10b4e47cfa4ad899b2cfbb517ce4ff">Helping the Troops</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b02edc4f0c9144e083c913bc54678f6a"> Civilians on both sides helped those in uniform. They raised money, provided aid for soldiers and their families, and ran emergency hospitals. Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to receive a license to practice medicine, organized a group that pressured President Lincoln to form the U.S. Sanitary Commission in June 1861. The Sanitary, as it was called, was run by clergyman Henry Bellows. Tens of thousands of volunteers worked with the U.S. Sanitary Commission to send bandages, medicines, and food to Union army camps and hospitals. Some 3,000 women served as nurses in the Union army.</p>

            <p class="name" data-uuid="4c75090dbde84f198f31b279f44d2627">Elizabeth Blackwell</p>
            <p class="date" data-uuid="41da0f87ba374b939946ab96a9228de2">(1821–1910)</p>
            <p data-uuid="6afdd95fd74044ccabae0bef44f674e5">Elizabeth Blackwell was born in England in 1821, the fourth of nine children. In 1832 her family moved to the United States and settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, but her father died suddenly just five years later. Blackwell took different teaching jobs in several states to help her family earn money. </p>
            <p data-uuid="5beca0f76f55490493778ab14eed9f79">Blackwell wanted to become a doctor but didn’t know where to begin. Medical schools had only recently been created and they were for men only. She lived with the families of two physicians during her travels as a teacher. Both taught her and let her read their medical books. Blackwell began applying to medical colleges and only received one acceptance letter—as a joke. She went to the college anyway and worked hard despite being treated very poorly. She earned the respect of many teachers and students and graduated first in her class in 1849.</p>
            <p data-uuid="8ac79b4e129e49deac56c49097967ac7">Blackwell continued her training in Europe, where she was treated even worse than she was in the United States. She returned to New York in 1851 and established a respected medical practice by 1857 with her sister, Emily (the third women to receive a medical degree in the United States). The two sisters began the Woman’s Central Association of Relief in 1861 to channel public support of the war effort to where it was needed. Later, they worked with Dorothea Dix to train nurses for the Union army. </p>
            <p data-uuid="88ee190317144a68b42489732ff04347">After the war, Elizabeth Blackwell moved to England, where she continued her medical career and social reform work. She died in 1910 at her home in England shortly after suffering a stroke.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="03809ef8774b45e489bae6a4415eb350">Training the Soldiers</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f853ae8deeea4db79b55422ccb6df71f">Both the Union and Confederate armies faced shortages of clothing, food, and even rifles. While the U.S. Army troops had standard issue uniforms, volunteer militias frequently had their own uniforms and individual volunteers often simply wore their own clothes. Eventually, each side chose a color for their uniforms. The Union chose blue. The Confederates wore gray.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d07d97943975473e9c73090d744f1946">The problem with volunteers was that many of them had no idea how to fight. Schoolteachers, farmers, and laborers all had to learn the combat basics of marching, shooting, and using bayonets.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0d8aed465b7a4c9bbc9d15081c74b9e5"> Days in camp were long and boring. They typically began at 5 a.m. in summer and 6 a.m. in winter. After breakfast, the men took part in up to five daily drills. During these two-hour sessions, they learned and practiced battlefield maneuvers. Between drills, the troops cleaned the camp, gathered firewood, wrote letters home, and played games. With visions of glory and action, many young soldiers were eager to fight. They would not have to wait long.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4b79dc49d97f4c88b070a71d050fb562">Discipline and drill were used to turn raw volunteers into an efficient fighting machine. During a battle, the success or failure of a regiment often depended on its discipline—how well it responded to orders.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ad1504c6b9224666849e455d0a50f3b9">Volunteers also learned how to use rifles. Eventually, soldiers were expected to be able to load, aim, and fire their rifles three times in one minute. The quality of the weapons provided varied greatly. Most soldiers favored the Springfield and Enfield rifles for their accuracy. On the other hand, soldiers often complained about their Austrian and Belgian rifles. A soldier remarked, “I don’t believe one could hit the broadside of a barn with them.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="184c37f22293408fbe0b05b48765df26"> On average, soldiers spent about 75 percent of their time in camp. In wet weather, camps were a sea of mud. In dry weather, they were filled with clouds of dust. The Union army provided the infantry with two-person tents. However, soldiers often discarded these tents in favor of more portable ones. The Confederate army did not usually issue tents. Instead, Confederates often used tents that were captured from the Union army.</p>
