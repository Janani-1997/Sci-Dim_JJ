            was committed to the Cold War policy of stopping the spread of communism
            worldwide. He maintained strong military forces and expanded the nation’s
            supply of nuclear weapons. He also sought nonmilitary ways to defeat communism.
            For example, in a program called the Alliance for Progress, the United States
            pledged $20 billion in aid to countries in Latin America. This assistance did
            little to improve conditions in Latin America or U.S.–Latin American relations,
            however. Another nonmilitary program was more successful. Beginning in 1961,
            the <b><dfn title="Peace Corps">Peace Corps</dfn></b> sent
            volunteers to developing countries to help with projects such as digging wells
            and building schools.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="8f19edb578e3485a9dcbf19adbccbab0">Bay of Pigs</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9e6bcaf3f0f34adab8ddee5b55824f84">In his early days as president, much of Kennedy’s attention
            involved confronting communism with U.S. military forces. The first Cold War crisis
            during his administration took place in Cuba. In the late 1950s Cuban rebel <b><dfn title="Castro, Fidel">Fidel Castro</dfn></b> had led a
            revolution against an unpopular dictator. In 1959 he overthrew the dictator.
            Castro soon established a Communist government allied to the Soviet Union. Many
            Cubans who had opposed Castro fled to the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bed1f409f8214eb682b6f6f056001bde">Castro’s close ties with the Soviet Union worried Kennedy,
            especially since Cuba is only about 90 miles from Florida. Soviet leaders could
            use Cuba as a base from which to attack the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="719c7c005b6a463588cec103bee12862">While president, Dwight Eisenhower had developed a plan to remove
            Castro from power. The Central Intelligence Agency began training Cuban exiles
            to invade the island and overthrow Castro. Kennedy learned of the plan when he
            became president. He approved the operation.</p>
        <p data-uuid="999a4048a81346ed8583f3f582079b26">
            On April 17, 1961, about 1,500 Cuban exiles landed by
            boat at Cuba’s Bay of Pigs. Castro’s forces quickly responded, killing about
            300 of the invaders and capturing the rest. Many Americans criticized Kennedy
            for the disastrous invasion attempt. His administration was off to a shaky
            start.</p>

        </h3>
        <p data-uuid="6ecf7863180a4a519f5b126daba286c1">Located behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany, the city of
            Berlin was the site of Kennedy’s second crisis. East Berlin was part of Communist
            East Germany. West Berlin remained a part of democratic West Germany. It stood
            as a model of prosperity and freedom. About 2.5 million East Germans fled to
            West Berlin between 1949 and 1961. They were desperate for freedom and better
            economic opportunities. The steady loss of skilled workers alarmed Communist
            officials. Calling the open border between East and West Berlin a “handy escape
            route,” Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev demanded that the border be closed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d69cdb8314e44614a7cd92522f4c0e80">
            Khrushchev threatened to take over West Berlin.
            President Kennedy responded by vowing to defend the free city. “We cannot and
            will not permit the Communists to drive us out of Berlin,” he warned. Then, on
            the night of August 12–13, 1961, the East German government began building the <b><dfn title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</dfn></b>, a barrier of
            concrete and barbed wire between East and West Berlin. Kennedy rushed American
            troops to West Berlin. But he was unwilling to go to war with the Soviet Union
            over the Berlin Wall. The wall stood as a symbol of the Cold War for nearly three
            decades.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="d420f3bbc4dc489982bc5370634beb1c">The Cuban Missile Crisis</h3>
        <p data-uuid="30c56795a7fe444485982296f17016db">In October 1962 Kennedy faced
            yet another problem in Cuba. American U-2 spy planes discovered that the
            Soviets were installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. If launched, the missiles
            could reach, and possibly destroy, American cities within minutes.</p>

            the <b><dfn title="Cuban missile crisis">Cuban missile crisis</dfn></b>, the
            U.S. Navy formed a blockade around Cuba. The blockade was designed to prevent
            Soviet ships from bringing in more weapons. As Soviet ships approached the
            blockade, terrified Americans waited tensely for news updates. Then came some
            welcome news—the Soviet ships had turned back.</p>
