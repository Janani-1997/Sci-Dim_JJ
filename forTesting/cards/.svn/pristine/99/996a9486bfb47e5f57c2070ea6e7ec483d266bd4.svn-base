For example, <i>war chief</i> was used to indicate <i>commanding general</i> and <i>iron fish </i>meant <i>submarine</i>.</p>

Nimitz learned that the Japanese were planning an attack on Port Moresby, New Guinea, an island just north of Australia. If the Japanese took New Guinea, they would have a base from which to invade Australia. In May 1942 Nimitz sent Allied forces to stop the Japanese fleet. </p>

In this battle both sides used a new kind of strategy. The opposing ships did not fire a single shot. In fact, they often were not in view of each other. Instead, airplanes taking off from the huge aircraft carriers attacked the ships. Although each side suffered heavy losses, neither won a clear victory. Still, the Japanese assault on Port Moresby was stopped.<br />

The <b><dfn title="Battle of Midway">Battle of Midway</dfn></b> began on June 4, 1942, when Japan started bombing the islands. American aircraft carriers launched their planes, catching the Japanese aircraft carriers while many of their planes were refueling on deck. American dive bombers destroyed four of Japan’s aircraft carriers, severely weakening Japanese naval power. “Pearl Harbor has now been partially avenged,” said Nimitz.</p>

In August 1942 American marines invaded Guadalcanal, one of the Solomon Islands northeast of Australia. Intense fighting raged for nearly six months. Marine Louis Ortega remembered that enemy bombs and bullets were only part of the danger in the hot, rainy jungles of Guadalcanal. Soldiers also suffered from diseases, such as malaria, and from hunger due to lack of supplies. “I had gone to Guadalcanal weighing about 150,” Ortega said. “I left weighing about 110.” American forces finally took control of the island in February 1943.<br />
