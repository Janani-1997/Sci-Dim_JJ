        <p data-uuid="5785deb3da8b4ef0bba5db238f4c1033">American creativity extended to the ways in which people designed buildings. Before the American Revolution, most architects followed the style used in Great Britain. After the Revolution, leaders such as Thomas Jefferson called for Americans to model their architecture after the styles used in ancient Greece and Rome. Many Americans admired the ancient civilization of Greece and the Roman Republic because they contained some of the same democratic and republican ideals as the new American nation did.<br />

Growing American cities soon had distinctive new buildings designed in the Greek and Roman styles. These buildings were usually made of marble or other stone and featured large, stately columns. </span></p>
        <p data-uuid="8b17df410153483eb60d9c6b6d495d21"> Americans also embraced educational progress. Noah Webster, well known for his dictionary of American English published in 1828, spent much of his life working to provide children with a distinctly American education.<br />

        <p data-uuid="383fd26552314d4c89445d2d2acfa05b">Several early American political leaders expressed a belief that democracy would only succeed in a country of educated and enlightened people. But there was no general agreement on who should provide that education.</p>
        <p data-uuid="892461941447433e91929f647ccb56ee"> Eventually, the idea of a state-funded public school gathered support. In 1837 Massachusetts lawmakers created a state board of education. Other states followed this example, and the number of public schools slowly grew.<br />
