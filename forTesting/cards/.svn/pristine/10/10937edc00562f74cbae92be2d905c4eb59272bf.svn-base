        <p data-uuid="94bc495e5494411aafc8e00a30252978">While some Americans struggled against the British on land in the former colonies, others fought at sea and on the western frontier. Each area posed tough challenges.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="1f4a73c435584cedaa1e5a4003dd9dba">War at Sea</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3fb109c186ba427aa6d31aacc72eb7a6">The entry of the French navy into the war greatly aided the colonists. Many people had thought that the mighty British navy would crush the much smaller American fleet. However, the British failed to use their powerful navy effectively during the war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6924f00c6f6544f8ba8af1342ad39fa5">In the fall of 1775, the Continental Congress made plans to build four American warships. Soon afterward the Congress formally established the marines and the Continental navy. By adapting merchant vessels, the navy had eight fighting ships ready for combat by February 1776.</p>

It was the first major naval battle between the two powers after France formed an alliance with the Patriots. </p>

        <p data-uuid="1d155a2b30514e29904aa7dce2b36727"> That month the tiny American navy launched a major offensive to damage the operating ability of the British fleet located off the Carolina coast. Rather than attack the fleet directly, the Patriots went after the British supply base on Nassau, in the Bahamas.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="6180b4890b5c4bbcac3f672682133bd4">The American troops seized the main supply fort on the island. They then raised the newly created flag of the American Revolution over Nassau. After that campaign, the American navy focused on seizing British supply ships and weakening Britain’s naval forces in the West Indies.<br />

        <h3 class="wrap-text" data-uuid="d7e53832883245469ee43ecdfe1b0ac6">John Paul Jones</h3>
        <p data-uuid="292389b71a8c400191a80f924a767872">The Patriots owed much of their success on the seas to naval hero <b><dfn title="Jones, John Paul">John Paul Jones</dfn></b>. Jones had once been considered an outlaw. He was born John Paul in Scotland and began working on ships at a young age. After accidentally killing the leader of a mutiny, he fled to America and added Jones to his name.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3149928ba3774309bd47b7ad248f9fbf">When the war broke out, Jones volunteered his services to the newly created navy. He quickly established himself as a brave and clever sailor. Considered a pirate by the British, Jones captured many British supply ships. The French greatly admired Jones. When France entered the war in 1778, French leaders presented him with a small fleet of seven &#173;vessels to command. He named his flagship <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> (“Gentleman Richard”) in honor of Benjamin Franklin’s <i>Poor Richard’s Almanac.</i> Among the almanac’s stories, jokes, and wise sayings were weather forecasts for the year and other practical scientific information.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9981c0ee5bf647a99aa1f443b264f83b"> One of Jones’s most famous victories was the capture of the British warship <i>Serapis</i> on September 23, 1779. Early in the battle, the British knocked out the heaviest artillery on the <i>Bonhomme Richard.</i> Captain Richard Pearson of the <i>Serapis</i> then called out to Jones, “Has your ship struck [surrendered]?” Jones replied, “I have not yet begun to fight!” The battle continued for more than two hours. Finally, the Americans wore down the British, who surrendered at 10:30 p.m.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3e8c1b127f5c422c8f99ae1e05977440">The lands west of the Appalachian Mountains were controlled by Native American nations. Both the British and the Patriots tried to enlist these groups in their cause.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8e250c9eb80446019e361343e026ef71"><b><dfn title="Clark, George Rogers">George Rogers Clark</dfn></b> volunteered to lead the western campaign. Clark had been a surveyor along the Ohio and Kentucky rivers. By the time the war broke out, he knew the lands of the Ohio River valley well. Clark created an army from the scattered settlements in the area. One of the best-known groups was the Over Mountain Men, a band of settlers from present-day Tennessee.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e2c0b8c8babf44dbb2fac933d3c8b377"> Determined to weaken British support systems, Clark targeted trading villages. Following the Ohio River to the Tennessee, Clark’s force set out on a 120-mile overland trek to Kaskaskia, in present-day Illinois. The village’s leaders learned of the attack and surrendered. Other Patriots took Cahokia without a fight.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6dabce14c80e4127bbb3a3cc0980735a">In February 1779 Clark launched a surprise attack on Fort Sackville near the town of Vincennes. The attack was unexpected because the nearby Wabash River was icy and flooded. Despite overflowing riverbanks, Clark’s force of 150 men endured an 18-day march through freezing water. They also managed to bring enough Patriot flags for an army of hundreds. The flags were displayed near the fort, and the skilled pioneers sustained enough musket fire to indicate a much larger army. Falling for the ruse, the commander of Fort Sackville surrendered.</p>
        <p data-uuid="87502b6663874bbb9968e618f2879bfd"> In general the British were more successful at winning over the Native Americans. But Clark’s many campaigns undermined British support in the West.</p>
