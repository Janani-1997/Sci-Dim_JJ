            <p data-uuid="dd028a79195c4d4285c34b3281ab5e60">The
                United States faced many new challenges as the 21st century began. A
                contested race for president in 2000, terrorist attacks, and the War on Terror
                dominated the beginning years. In 2008 the United States and the world plunged
                into what became known as the Great Recession, as a crisis in housing loans
                sparked panic and increased unemployment. It was also the year that American
                voters made history by electing the first African American president. At the
                same time, rapid technological and demographic changes were transforming the
                lives of all Americans.</p>
            <h6 data-uuid="8c0aa3a9f4754bcd82c12aacbb221ec1">Task</h6>
            <p data-uuid="6b9cde26f83d46009bbbb2d904f66492">The
                early 21st century heralded a period of instability in the world after
                terrorists attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, and the United
                States responded by leading a coalition of nations in a War on Terror. It also
                was a period of economic and technological change as the world endured an
                economic slowdown and  developments in
                computing, medicine, and the environment transformed how people lived and
                worked. Write an essay in which you explain what factors contributed to the
                changes that altered the American way of life in the early 21st century.
