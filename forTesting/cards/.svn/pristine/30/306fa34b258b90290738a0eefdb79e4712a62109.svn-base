            President Bush’s handling of the Gulf War. By the time of the 1992 election,
            however, the struggling U.S. economy had become a more important issue for most
            voters. Arkansas governor <b><dfn title="Clinton, Bill">Bill
            Clinton</dfn></b> was the Democratic nominee for president. He told voters he
            would focus on improving the economy. Clinton won a three-way race against Bush
            and H. Ross Perot, who ran as an independent candidate.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ec9826e954b74ef9bf9b0cb8f1c60eb8">Under President Clinton’s leadership, Congress
            passed a budget. It was designed to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and
            raising taxes. He also convinced Congress to support the <b><dfn title="North American Free Trade Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</dfn></b> (NAFTA). This treaty
            eliminated trade barriers between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The
            treaty was controversial. Supporters claimed that it would strengthen the
            economies of all three nations. Critics argued that the United States would
            lose jobs to Mexico, where wages were lower.

        <p data-uuid="f729cfb3f080468bbcf4763f90deae9a">A growing economy helped Clinton win a second
            term in 1996 over Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. By 1998 the U.S. government was
            taking in more money than it was spending. However, questions about Clinton’s
            personal and official conduct dominated his second term. Government
            investigators charged that the president had conducted an improper relationship
            with a White House intern and then lied about it under oath. In 1998 the House
            of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton for obstruction of justice. The
            Senate acquitted him of the charges in 1999. The scandal damaged Clinton’s
            public image, though his approval ratings remained high, due in part to the
            booming economy.</p>

                Clinton was born in Hope, Arkansas. As a teenager he met and shook hands with
                President John Kennedy. This experience heightened his interest in becoming a
                politician. He became a Rhodes scholar at Oxford after graduating from college.
                After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas. He was
                elected governor in 1978. He lost his bid for re-election in 1980. Clinton ran
                again in 1982 and won, serving ten more years as governor. Clinton was elected
                president in 1992 and re-elected in 1996. The country experienced the longest
                period of continued economic growth during his presidency. In 1998, however,
                Clinton became only the second president in U.S. history to be impeached.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8db0055c7e1f4ccfbf83e2271d8da3cf">The collapse of the Soviet Union left the
            United States as the world’s only superpower. In 1997 President Clinton
            appointed <b><dfn title="Albright, Madeleine">Madeleine Albright</dfn></b>
            as the first woman to be secretary of state. Albright had been born in Prague.
            Her family then moved to the United States, fleeing the Holocaust. She helped
            adapt U.S. foreign policy to this complex new world.</p>
        <p data-uuid="48a46e1c284a438b883d0f17cb631ba9">The United States worked to promote global
            peace and democracy. In the Balkan region of Europe, for example, civil war
            erupted in Yugoslavia. Several of its republics declared independence. In
            Bosnia, one of the former republics, fighting broke out in 1992 among three
            groups: Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Croats, and Serbs. Many Bosniak civilians
            were killed or forced out of Serb-controlled territory. These actions were
            known as “ethnic cleansing.” After more than three years of bloody fighting,
            the United States helped negotiate a peace agreement. President Clinton then
            sent 20,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia to help maintain peace.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7cc5147e9b3948d3bd2aee9b44792c27">Clinton also took an active role in the Oslo
            peace process. The process started in 1993, when Israel and the Palestinian
            Authority agreed to take steps toward a negotiated settlement of their
            conflict. The process broke down in 2000, after the failure of talks aimed at a
            final agreement.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1bf94506932347cfb42dc2f7278d8c4b">
            In the 1990s, <b><dfn title="terrorism">terrorism</dfn></b>—the
            use of violence by individuals or small groups to advance political
            goals—became a major issue. In April 1995 American terrorists bombed a federal
            government office building in Oklahoma City. The attack killed 168 people and
            injured hundreds of others. Timothy McVeigh led the terrorists. McVeigh was an
            ex-Army soldier who held extreme views against the government. The United
            States also faced increasingly deadly attacks by extremist Islamic groups.
            Hundreds were killed in bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998.<br />
