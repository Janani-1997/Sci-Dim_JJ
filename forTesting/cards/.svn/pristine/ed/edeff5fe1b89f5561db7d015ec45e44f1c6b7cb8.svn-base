        <p data-uuid="af99b69f3a2349d4be12d710b7f3e365">From 1860 to 1900 the U.S. population more than doubled. To feed this growing population, the number of farms tripled. With modern machines, farmers in 1900 could harvest a bushel of wheat almost 20 times faster than they could in 1830.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="d0e0197e58c244e9be70179b438ab500">The combination of more farms and greater productivity, however, led to overproduction. Overproduction resulted in lower prices for crops. As their incomes decreased, many farmers found it difficult to pay bills. Farmers who could not make their mortgage payments lost their farms and homes. Many of these homeless farmers became tenant farmers who worked land owned by others. By 1880 one-fourth of all farms were rented by tenants, and the number continued to grow. </p>

                which followed big harvests. How did good harvests create hard times? The
                answer is the law of supply and demand.&#160;The
                amount of goods available for sale is the <b>supply</b>.
                The willingness and ability of consumers to buy goods is called <b>demand</b>.<b> </b>The law of supply and demand
                says that when supply increases or demand decreases, prices fall. By contrast,
                when supply decreases or demand rises, prices rise.</p>

            <article data-uuid="afb8252292654757a437b4bd8e4df1b0">
                <p data-uuid="474e0b0789964fb1912d343aee0eb260">Many farmers blamed businesspeople—wholesalers, brokers, grain buyers, and especially railroad owners—for making money at their expense. As economic conditions worsened, farmers began to follow the example of other workers. They formed associations to protect and help their interests.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <p data-uuid="05fa5b6644ff4205b017d49fa1598068">One such organization was founded by Oliver Hudson Kelley, who toured the South in 1866 for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Kelley saw firsthand how the country's farmers suffered. Afterward, Kelley and several government clerks formed the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry in 1867. The <b><dfn title="National Grange">National Grange</dfn></b> was a social and educational organization for farmers. (Grange is an old word for granary.) Local chapters were quickly founded, and membership grew rapidly.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="5dd7652ed20849f19fd2849ef10e0877">The Grange campaigned for political candidates who supported farmers’ goals. The organization also called for laws that regulated rates charged by railroads. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1877 that the government could regulate railroads because they affected the public interest. In 1886 the Court said that the federal government could only regulate companies doing business across state lines. Rate regulation for railroad lines within states fell to the state governments.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a10af5bf49844cb5bfb2bac9fd7d32e5">In February 1887 Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act. This established national regulations over trade between states and created the Interstate Commerce Commission to ensure fair railroad rates. However, the commission lacked power to enforce its regulations.</p>

            <article data-uuid="f4642c9030754017b40f5383954e05c0">
                <p data-uuid="8cd283356df4457aa06781989459fa42">Money issues also caused problems for farmers. Many farmers hoped
                    that help would come from new laws affecting the money supply.</p>
                <p data-uuid="3bce0fe480f74b14a50906120cbaccf8">Since 1873 the United States had been on the gold standard,
                    meaning that all paper money had to be backed by gold in the treasury. As a
                    result, the money supply grew more slowly than the nation's population and led
                    to <b><dfn title="deflation">deflation</dfn></b>—a
                    decrease in the money supply and overall lower prices. One solution was to
                    allow the unlimited coining of silver and to back paper currency with silver.
                    This was the position of those in the Free Silver movement.</p>
                <p data-uuid="fd1052c833b5485197d0653a84aec98d">During the late 1870s, there was a great deal of support for the
                    Free Silver movement. Many farmers began backing political candidates who
                    favored free silver coinage. One such candidate was <b><dfn title="Bryan, William Jennings">William Jennings Bryan</dfn></b> of
                    Nebraska.</p>
                <p data-uuid="113346e54af044bda021331296d6fa7c">
                    The two major political parties, however,
                    largely ignored the money issue. After the election of 1888, the Republican-controlled
                    Congress passed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. The act increased the amount
                    of silver purchased for coinage. However, this did not help farmers as much as
                    they had hoped.</p>

                    Silverites</h3>
                <p data-uuid="c3a463bda7da45ec9ff3df41c337f6dd">In 1873 the U.S. government took silver coins
                    out of circulation, thereby reducing the amount of available currency. “Gold
                    bugs”—mostly bankers and business people—supported this action. “Silverites,”
                    who wanted to return silver into circulation, opposed it. Silver currency would
                    allow for more, and cheaper, money to be available. This would increase the
                    buying power of less wealthy farmers and other westerners.&#160;</p>

At a conference in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1891, Alliance leaders met with labor and reform groups. Then, at a convention in St. Louis in February 1892, the Alliances formed a new national political party.<br />

It also favored the “free and unlimited coinage of silver.” To gain the votes of workers, the Populists backed an eight-hour workday and limits on immigration.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3f041f3a001641a4a862420f606ae0f6">The concerns of the Populists were soon put in the national spotlight. During the Panic of 1893, the U.S. economy experienced a crisis that some critics blamed on the shortage of gold. The failure of several major railroad companies also contributed to the economic problems.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3c9b3feee01a4f139f12110c1afe4951">The Panic of 1893 led more people to back the Populist call for economic reform. In 1896 the Republicans nominated William McKinley for president. McKinley was firmly against free coinage of silver. The Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan, who favored free coinage.</p>
