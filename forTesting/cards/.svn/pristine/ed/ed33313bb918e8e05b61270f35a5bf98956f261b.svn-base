        <p data-uuid="29c271a5917042ea85ae144903f31f85">Meanwhile, the poorly supplied Patriots kept the British pinned down inside Boston. Although British leaders were trying to form a battle plan, they awoke on June 17 to a stunning sight. The colonial forces had quietly dug in at Breed’s Hill, a point overlooking north Boston. The Redcoats would have to cross Boston Harbor and fight their way uphill.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ad759e064be94e949ea59931680be92f"> As the British force of 2,400 advanced, 1,600 militia members waited. Low on gunpowder, the commander ordered his troops not to fire “until you see the whites of their eyes.” As they climbed the exposed hillside with their heavy packs, the British soldiers were cut down. Twice they retreated. Stepping over the dead and wounded, they returned for a third try. The colonists were now out of ammunition, and eventually they had to retreat.<br />

While the Patriots lost, they proved they could take on the Redcoats. For the British, the battle was a tragic victory. To win, they had sacrificed about double the number of Patriot soldiers.</p>

        <p data-uuid="676a4576d0a141969a6bbabeccc4e878"> Shortly after the Battle of Bunker Hill, General Washington arrived in Boston to command the Continental army. Washington knew that he would need heavier guns to drive the British out of Boston, and he knew where to get them—Fort Ticonderoga. Colonel Henry Knox was assigned to transport the captured cannons from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston. He successfully brought the heavy guns over 300 miles of rough terrain in the middle of winter. When Knox delivered the cannons, Washington was ready to regain control of Boston.</p>

        <p data-uuid="47fae37f6aef47978147b15f7a5103a2">On March 4, 1776, Washington moved his army to Dorchester Heights, an area that overlooked Boston from the south. He stationed the cannons and his troops on Nook’s Hill overlooking British general William Howe’s position. When Howe awoke the next morning and saw the Patriots’ well-positioned artillery, he knew he would have to retreat. “The Rebels have done more in one night than my whole army could do in months,” Howe declared. On March 7 Howe retreated from Boston to Canada. The birthplace of the rebellion was now in Patriot hands.<br />
