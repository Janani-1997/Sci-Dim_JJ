In response, the Grand Assembly of Virginia enacted laws designed to control servants and slaves. Such laws prevented servants and slaves from meeting together or moving about freely. Some laws, like Act VIII of 1672, enabled colonists to administer harsh punishments, including death, for violation of these laws.</p>

We always slept on the floor, pallet here, and a pallet there. Just like, uh, lot of, uh, wild people, we didn’t, we didn't know nothing. Didn’t allow you to look at no book. And then there was some free born colored people, why they had a little education, but there was very few of them, where we was. And they all had uh, what you call, I might call it now, uh, jail centers, was just the same as we was in jail. Now I couldn’t go from here across the street, or I couldn't go through nobody’s house without I have a note, or something from my master. And if I had that pass, that was what we call a pass, if I had that pass, I could go wherever he sent me. And I’d have to be back, you know, when uh. Whoever he sent me to, they, they’d give me another pass and I’d bring that back so as to show how long I'd been gone. We couldn’t go out and stay a hour or two hours or something like. They send you. Now, say for instance I’d’s place. I’d have to walk. And I would have to be back maybe in a hour. Maybe they’d give me hour. I don’t know just how long they’d give me. But they’d give me a note so there wouldn’t nobody interfere with me, and tell who I belong to. And when I come back, why I carry it to my master and give that to him, that’d be all right. But I couldn’t just walk away like the people does now, you know. It was what they call, we were slaves. We belonged to people. They’d sell us like they sell horses and cows and hogs and all like that. Have a auction bench, and they’d put you on, up on the bench and bid on you just same as you bidding on cattle you know.</p>
