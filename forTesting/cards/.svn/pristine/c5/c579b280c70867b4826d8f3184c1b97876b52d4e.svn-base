            canal across the narrow neck of Central America would link the Atlantic and
            Pacific oceans and cut some 8,000 miles off the voyage by ship from the West to
            the East coasts of the United States. It would also allow the U.S. Navy to link

            American canal than President Theodore Roosevelt. He knew it made good economic
            and political sense to build the canal. It would reduce travel time for
            commercial and military transport. The Spanish-American War, fought in both
            oceans, also made clear the need for such a shortcut.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dbadf22f9e034cdd9823533abd2a52fd">
            Roosevelt knew that the best
            spot for the canal was the Isthmus of Panama. At the time, this area was part
            of the nation of Colombia. Roosevelt was unable to convince the Colombian
            senate to lease a strip of land across Panama to the United States.<br />

            of the land. He learned that Panamanian revolutionaries were planning a revolt
            against Colombia. On November 2, 1903, a U.S. warship arrived outside Col&#243;n,
            Panama. The next day, the revolt began. Blocked by the U.S. warship, Colombian
            forces could not reach Panama to stop the rebellion. Panama declared itself an
            independent country. The United States then recognized the new nation. </p>

            The new government of Panama
            supported the idea of a canal across its land. The United States agreed to pay
            Panama $10 million plus $250,000 a year for a 99-year lease on a ten-mile-wide
            strip of land across the isthmus.<br />

            construction began in 1904. Building the canal was a huge challenge. The first
            obstacle to overcome was tropical disease. The canal route ran through 51 miles
            of forests and swamps filled with mosquitoes, many of which carried the deadly
            diseases malaria and yellow fever.<br />

        <p data-uuid="b1827f54ffde4d80ae2d9424a12522f1">Dr. William C. Gorgas, who had helped Dr.
            Walter Reed stamp out yellow fever in Cuba, organized a successful effort to
            rid the canal route of disease-carrying mosquitoes. If Gorgas had not been
            successful, the canal’s construction would have taken much longer. It also
            would have cost much more in terms of both lives and money.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8c4a063faa9a4aeaafa6503e10217883">
            Even with the reduced risk of
            disease, the work was very dangerous. Most of the canal had to be blasted out
            of solid rock with explosives. Workers used dozens of steam shovels to cut a
            narrow, eight-mile-long channel through the mountains of central Panama.
            Sometimes workers died when their shovels struck explosive charges. “The flesh
            of men flew in the air like birds every day,” recalled one worker from the West
            Indies.<br />

            than 44,000 workers, including many black West Indians, labored on the canal.
            Some 6,000 lives were lost during the American construction of the <b><dfn title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</dfn></b>. It was finally
            opened to ships on August 15, 1914, linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. An
            opening ceremony was held the next year. It had taken ten years to complete,
            and the cost was $375 million. It was probably the most expensive construction
            project in the world at that time. In the end, however, the world had its
            “highway between the oceans.” Building
            the canal also began to change the relationship between the United States and
