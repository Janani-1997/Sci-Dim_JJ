        <p data-uuid="adbf0f6e90204024b70584518213c68d">The end of World War I had an immediate impact on the economy. Because the government no longer needed war supplies, it canceled billions of dollars’ worth of contracts with American factories. This meant that factories cut back on production at the very moment that millions of soldiers left the military and began looking for jobs. The result was a sharp rise in unemployment. Meanwhile, many people who did have jobs rushed to buy products they could not buy during the war. Prices soared. Wages could not keep up with the rising prices, and thus workers could no longer afford to buy the goods they needed and wanted. Many went on strike for higher wages—more than 4 million in 1919 alone.</p>
        <p data-uuid="05cb532265494fd09caf80993ffe4194">As the 1920 presidential election approached, the economic difficulties were bad news for the party in power, Woodrow Wilson’s Democratic Party. Many voters blamed the Democrats for the hard times. Sensing the public’s anger, the Republicans looked for a candidate who would offer new hope for American voters. They chose <b><dfn title="Harding, Warren G.">Warren G. Harding</dfn></b>, a senator from Ohio. Harding picked Governor <b><dfn title="Coolidge, Calvin">Calvin Coolidge</dfn></b> of Massachusetts as his running mate.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3477863529724ebbacee2824c077b3eb"> Harding based his campaign strategy on a promise to return the country to stability and prosperity, what he called “normalcy.” His conservative policies contrasted with the reform-minded policies of the Progressive Era. Harding summed up his ideas in a campaign speech:<br />

Cox for president and New York’s Franklin D. Roosevelt for vice-president. But Harding’s promise of a return to normalcy captured the public’s mood in 1920. Harding won a landslide victory with about 60 percent of the popular vote.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5874406798774309817b66be8bcc63da">Harding worked quickly to help strengthen the economy. He put together a cabinet of experts who believed in reducing money owed by the government and limiting government involvement in the economy. Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon pushed for tax cuts for wealthy Americans. Mellon believed that this policy would give the wealthy an incentive to invest in new businesses and create new jobs for other Americans. Mellon’s opponents called this idea the trickle-down theory, arguing that money would only “trickle down” in small drops to less-well-off Americans.</p>

        <p data-uuid="81918cb04ee84b9d975610b52f3afbb6"> Harding faced problems in other areas, however. He had appointed many of his trusted friends to high positions. Some of these men used their positions to gain wealth through illegal means. “I have no trouble with my enemies,” Harding once said. “But my . . . friends . . . keep me walking the floor nights.”<br />

In exchange, Fall allowed the companies to control government oil reserves in Elk Hills, California, and Teapot Dome, Wyoming. The U.S. Senate soon began investigating Fall, who was convicted of accepting bribes. He was the first cabinet member ever to be convicted of a crime for his actions while in office.</p>
