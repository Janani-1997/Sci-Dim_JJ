By 1968 more than 500,000 U.S. troops were serving in Vietnam. Backed by superior military technology, U.S. generals expected to win a quick victory.

The younger McCain also attended the Naval Academy and served in Vietnam as a combat pilot. On a bombing mission over Hanoi in 1967, his plane was shot down. McCain was held as a prisoner of war (POW) for more than five years. He was often tortured and kept in solitary confinement. McCain entered politics after the war. In 2010 he was elected to his fifth term as U.S. senator from Arizona. One of his priorities as a senator has been to help repair and strengthen U.S. relations with Vietnam. McCain was the Republican nominee for president in 2008.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c641d64b0d574920b3ef57c6169e5717">In Vietnam there was rarely a front line where armies met face to face. Much of the war was fought in the jungles and villages of South Vietnam. General <b><dfn title="Westmoreland, William">William Westmoreland</dfn></b> commanded the U.S. ground forces involved in Vietnam. He developed a strategy based on <b><dfn title="search-and-destroy missions">search-and-destroy missions</dfn></b>. During these missions U.S. patrols searched for hidden enemy camps, then destroyed them with massive firepower and air raids.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b072a7f4acad400383caf55da544794d"> To make up for their disadvantage in firepower, Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops used guerrilla warfare tactics. Moving quickly, they set deadly traps and land mines. They also knew the local geography. This allowed them to make quick surprise assaults on small groups of U.S. soldiers. Though the Vietcong and NVA suffered high casualty rates, they were able to match U.S. escalation by continuing to send new troops into combat. They also received supplies and weapons from Communist China and the Soviet Union.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6ad6feaaaa3a486bae2c5f40d600ca26">The civilians of South Vietnam were often caught in the middle of the fighting. Vietcong forces entered villages at night. The forces killed people they believed were cooperating with the South Vietnamese government. South Vietnamese and American troops attacked villages they suspected of assisting the Vietcong. About 4 million South Vietnamese were driven from their homes. This undermined the crucial U.S. goal of winning the support and loyalty of South Vietnamese civilians.</p>

        <p data-uuid="bba3155e6a2e421e942fb2aeb014f09a">More than 2 million American soldiers served in the Vietnam War. Their average age was 18–21, several years younger than in previous American wars. About one-quarter of the soldiers were drafted, many from minority groups and poor families. College students—most of whom were white and from wealthier families—were able to get draft releases called deferments.</p>

        <p data-uuid="095796fef07f40ef8a317d7b14aa7219">American troops patrolled jungles and rice paddies, carrying 75–90 pounds of equipment through 100-degree heat and rainstorms that could last for days. They never knew when they might run into enemy fire. Soldiers also faced the constant danger of land mines and booby traps. “We required this kind of instant hair-trigger alertness,” said marine officer Philip Caputo. “You simply trusted absolutely no one. I mean, from a 5-year-old kid to a 75-year-old woman.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="a2074443ca8e489481fc7bf97c3d88ce"> While American troops were often able to win individual battles, they were rarely able to control the territory they had won for long. “You were just constantly walking out over the same ground,” Caputo explained. “The enemy you were supposed to be defeating statistically kept coming back for more.”</p>
