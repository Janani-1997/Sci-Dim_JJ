        <p data-uuid="bf5f2d0fe0584393962177ff804104f1">Just before details of the Teapot Dome scandal became public, President Harding died of a heart attack. In August 1923 Vice-President Calvin Coolidge took charge. Coolidge had a strong reputation as an honest and trustworthy leader. These qualities helped him restore confidence in the government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="72fb377fb59e44b79616d6d0dcdbaa6f"> Coolidge acted quickly to fire all officials who had been involved in the bribery scandals of Harding’s administration. This helped him win the presidential election in 1924. He received nearly twice as many votes as the Democratic candidate, John W. Davis.<br />

            <p data-uuid="de5709bbae774ac9993e663656c069aa">When Calvin Coolidge was only 12 years old, his mother died. Coolidge had to take over many duties on the family farm while going to school. He had another setback when he failed a college entrance exam. He studied hard and finally passed. Coolidge’s determination helped him rise in politics from city council member in Northampton, Massachusetts, to president of the United States.</p>
            <p data-uuid="69403f1378664b518a82895018e8170a"> Grace Coolidge’s warm, outgoing personality greatly benefited her husband’s political career. As First Lady, Grace had a striking memory for names and faces. She enjoyed entertaining artists, actors, and writers at the White House. Grace’s colorful personality was a welcome contrast to Calvin’s quiet demeanor.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ef79bb6144464f78af8085ce61954e4e">Coolidge proved to be even more probusiness than Harding had been. He once declared that “the business of America is business.” He expanded the policies started under Harding, such as tax cuts for wealthier citizens. He also supported raising tariffs on foreign goods to decrease competition with domestic products. Despite higher tariffs, trade with other countries actually increased under Coolidge. This was mainly because many nations depended on trade with the United States to rebuild their economies after World War I. Not everyone profited from Coolidge’s efforts, however. Coolidge vetoed congressional attempts to provide aid to farmers through the regulation of prices.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2b9f88961bea48c6a5c098198562b969"> Like the United States, European nations wanted a return to prosperity. Europeans also wanted to avoid another devastating war. In 1928 the United States and 14 other nations signed the <b><dfn title="Kellogg-Briand Pact">Kellogg-Briand Pact</dfn></b>, an agreement that outlawed war. Eventually, 62 nations accepted the pact. There was no way to enforce the pact, however. One U.S. senator complained that the treaty would be “as effective to keep down war as a carpet would be to smother an earthquake.” Still, it was a sign that most countries wanted to prevent another global conflict. Today, countries still try to prevent wars with international agreements. More than 180 nations have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
