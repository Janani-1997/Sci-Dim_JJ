            Government</h3>
        <p data-uuid="0f82226efcec4265860c24608097e684">Most of the delegates to the Convention wanted a stronger
            central government than the Articles of Confederation could provide. They
            believed it was necessary for the protection and administration of the group of
            states. But delegates also wanted to protect the individual rights that had
            been won in the Revolution. They wanted the new system of government to support
            the ideals stated in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c44ceaac88e047d0a49d2e3c89cffb37">The rights of citizens to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of
            happiness” are supported by the idea of <dfn title="popular sovereignty">popular
            sovereignty</dfn>. This is the idea that political authority is in the hands of
            the people. In the new nation, people would express this power through their
            votes. The power of government is limited by the power of voters. In a
            republic, or representative democracy, the government consists of people
            elected by voters to represent them. This system requires government to depend
            on the consent of the governed. Voters can limit the actions of government by
            removing representatives who do not truly work for their goals. </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="34f043896d0945bba760c21376be637f">Checks
            and Balances</h3>
        <p data-uuid="635acdf2ac0046a280f673da503aaade">The delegates divided the power of the central government
            among three branches, each having specific roles. This arrangement is known as
            the separation of powers. The <dfn title="legislative branch">legislative
            branch</dfn>, called Congress, is responsible for proposing and passing laws. It
            is made up of two houses, as created in the Great Compromise. The Senate and
            the House of Representatives have different rules governing how many members
            represent each state, which helps balance the power between large and small
            states. The&#160;<dfn title="executive branch">executive branch</dfn> includes the president and the departments that help run the government.
            The executive branch makes sure that laws are carried out. The <dfn title="judicial branch">judicial
            branch</dfn> is made up of all the national courts. This branch is responsible
            for interpreting laws, punishing criminals, and settling disputes between
            states.</p>

            and balances</dfn>that keeps any
            branch of government from becoming too powerful. For example, Congress
            has the power to pass bills into law. The president has the power to veto, or
            reject, laws that Congress passes. However, Congress can override the
            president's veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The Supreme Court has the
            power to review laws passed by Congress and strike down any law that violates
            the Constitution.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4c9bbebb18ed49d88036291099070334">Federalism</h3>
        <p data-uuid="2b87dc84b4374d018ac1946ee582d6bb">Even though many of the delegates wanted a stronger central
            government, they did not want to destroy state governments. State governments
            can be more sensitive to local concerns and traditions, and they can serve as
            laboratories for new ideas. To balance the power between these two types of
            government, the delegates created the system of <dfn title="federalism">federalism</dfn>.<b> </b>Federalism<b> </b>divides
            the powers of government between a central government and the states that make
            up a nation. Under the previous confederal system, states were only loosely joined
            together. </p>
        <p data-uuid="c828cd4208624672acd9fec5965cccf4">The Constitution requires each state to obey the authority
            of the federal, or national, government. States have control over government
            functions not specifically assigned to the federal government. These include
            control of local government, education, the chartering of corporations, and the
            supervision of religious bodies. States also have the power to create and
            oversee civil and criminal law. States must protect the welfare of their
            citizens.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8e7cc816e76f46fd9f08e194a268285b">One of the most important decisions the framers made was to
            include a method for changing or adding to the Constitution. They wanted the
            government to be able to adapt as changes were needed. The process for amending
            the Constitution was made difficult, however, so that major changes to the government
            would require the support of a large majority of voters. Two-thirds of each
            house of Congress and three-fourths of states must approve a change before it
            can take effect. Although many amendments, or changes to the Constitution, have
            been suggested, only 27 have been approved. The purposes of these
            amendments have usually focused on protecting civil and voting rights, and on
            procedures for administering the government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="54d58b0b71f64a3ea9729eab80528f05">
            Even
            though the final draft of the Constitution was adopted by the Convention, many
            disagreements still existed among the delegates. Debates continued around the
            power of state governments and the role of each branch. Almost as soon as the
            document was adopted, different interpretations of its language began to
            appear. Some of the disagreements affect the views of lawmakers even today, but
            the Constitution is still the guiding blueprint for the nation’s government.<br />
