            <b><dfn title="telegraph">telegraph</dfn></b>—a device that could
            send information over wires across great distances. To develop the telegraph,
            Morse studied electricity and magnetism. In time, Morse put the work of other
            &#173;scientists together in a practical machine.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6b8ce4e2b9784e19a3e69888d03b4c6b">The telegraph sent pulses, or surges, of electric
            current through a wire. The telegraph operator tapped a bar, called a telegraph
            key, which controlled the length of each pulse. At the other end of the wire,
            these pulses were changed into clicking sounds. A short click was called a dot.
            A long click was called a dash. Morse’s partner, Alfred Lewis Vail, developed a
            system known as <b><dfn title="Morse code">Morse code</dfn></b>—different
            combinations of dots and dashes that represent each letter of the alphabet. For
            example, dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot is the distress signal called
            SOS. Skilled telegraph operators could send and receive many words per minute.</p>

                Morse began his career as a painter rather than as an inventor. In 1832 Morse
                was a widower struggling to raise his three children alone. He became interested
                in the idea of sending messages electrically. Morse hoped he could invent a device
                that would earn him enough money to support his family. Eventually, earnings
                from the telegraph made Morse extremely wealthy.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8ab9970b885645b6923e7cb25a1b0a9a">Several years passed before Morse was able to connect two locations with
            telegraph wires. Despite that achievement, people doubted his machine. Some
            people did not think that he was reading messages sent from miles away. They
            claimed that he was making lucky guesses.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f3606be4eb254ec5b99809e1092f0309">
            Morse’s break came during the 1844 Democratic
            National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland. A telegraph wired news of the
            presidential candidate’s nomination to politicians in Washington. The waiting
            politicians responded, “Three cheers for the telegraph!” Telegraphs were soon
            sending and receiving information for businesses, the government, and newspapers.
            This new tool helped businesses become more efficient by speeding up their communication.
            Private citizens also began using the telegraph to communicate socially.</p>
        <p data-uuid="952c66e54f044d15bb3365f22d8d762b">The telegraph grew with the railroad. Telegraph
            companies strung their wires on poles along railroads across the country. They
            established telegraph offices in many train stations. Thousands of miles of
            telegraph line were added every year in the 1850s. The first transcontinental
            line was finished in 1861. By the time he died in 1872, Morse was famous across
            the United States.</p>
