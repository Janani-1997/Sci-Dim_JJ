        <p data-uuid="98fb2f96f0d74cbeb09d604e655ef049">Abolitionists in the North used the stories of fugitive slaves like James Hamlet and Anthony Burns to gain sympathy for their cause. Slave narratives also educated people about the hardships of enslaved African Americans.</p>
        <p data-uuid="647cd789b7eb4a9b99c72a62a62c24f6">Fiction also informed people about the evils of slavery.<i> </i><i><dfn title="Uncle Tom’s Cabin"><i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i></dfn>,</i> the antislavery novel written by <b><dfn title="Stowe, Harriet Beecher">Harriet Beecher Stowe</dfn></b>, spoke out powerfully against slavery. Stowe, the daughter of Connecticut minister Lyman Beecher, moved to Ohio when she was 21. There she met fugitive slaves and learned about the cruelties of slavery. The Fugitive Slave Act greatly angered Stowe. She decided to write a book that would educate northerners about the realities of slavery.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3aa67ae95db14a9eaf8e936e18994e0f"><i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> was published in 1852. The main character, a kindly enslaved African American named Tom, is taken from his wife and sold “down the river” in Louisiana. Tom becomes the slave of cruel Simon Legree. In a rage, Legree has Tom beaten to death.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ee301868481a4bb39a359c42d81f9d15">The novel electrified the nation and sparked outrage in the South. Louisa McCord, a famous southern writer, questioned the “foul imagination which could invent such scenes.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="0c0659a1fa8f42a4915887c2ffe14544">Within a decade, more than 2 million copies of <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> were sold in the United States. The book’s popularity caused one northerner to remark that Stowe and her book had created “two millions of abolitionists.” Stowe later wrote <i>A Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin </i>to answer those who had criticized her book.</p>
        <p data-uuid="776f4ee4933f42849bcf5fb16c1c49fc"> The impact of Stowe’s book is suggested by her reported meeting with Abraham Lincoln in 1862, a year after the start of the Civil War. Lincoln supposedly said to Stowe that she was “the little lady who made this big war.” Her book is still widely read today as a source of information about the harsh realities of slavery.<br />
