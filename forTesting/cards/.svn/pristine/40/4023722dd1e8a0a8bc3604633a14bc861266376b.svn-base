        <p data-uuid="a60008ccf3624d44956042cd87390391">Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin made cotton so profitable that southern farmers abandoned other crops in favor of growing cotton. The removal of Native Americans opened up more land. The development of new types of cotton plants helped spread cotton production throughout the South from Virginia and North Carolina to as far west as Texas. This area of high cotton production became known as the <dfn title="cotton belt">cotton belt</dfn>.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f46fa5914a6e43b1b33e8a5212477851">Production increased rapidly—from about 2 million pounds in 1791 to roughly a billion pounds by 1860. As early as 1840, the United States was producing more than half of the cotton grown in the entire world. The economic boom attracted new settlers and built up wealth among wealthy white southerners. The cotton economy firmly put in place the institution of slavery in the South.</p>

        <p data-uuid="65a1858e11cf40569b0e1c28c9b4ea00">Cotton had many advantages as a cash crop. It cost little to market. Unlike food staples, harvested cotton could be stored for a long time. Because cotton was lighter than other staple crops, it also cost less to transport long distances.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5e0970f9aef24102b9d5621da8c02588">Farmers eager to profit from growing cotton headed west to find land. Farmers also began to apply scientific methods to improve crop production. Cotton had one disadvantage as a crop—it rapidly used up the nutrients in the soil. After a few years, cotton could make the land useless for growing anything. Some agricultural scientists recommended crop rotation—changing the crop grown on a particular plot of land every few years. Different crops needed different nutrients, so crop rotation would keep the land fertile longer. Other agricultural scientists began to study soil chemistry, in an effort to keep the land rich and productive.</p>
        <p data-uuid="924ad25cffc143deb1e589696a7c04fb">As the cotton belt grew, farmers continued trying to improve the crop. Agricultural scientists worked at crossbreeding short-staple cotton with other varieties. As a result, new stronger types of cotton were soon growing throughout the cotton belt. This led to expansion of the cotton industry through the 1860s.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3674d12e1021466d98a91013e7d39b09">The cotton boom involved much more than growing and harvesting cotton. Harvested cotton had to be ginned, pressed into bales, and then shipped to market or to warehouses. Special agents helped do everything. They helped market cotton to customers and also insured crops against loss or damage. Factories were built to produce items needed by cotton farmers, such as ropes to bale cotton.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3af295a441154398a9f94733ea47d18a"> Growing and harvesting cotton required many field hands. Rather than pay wages to free workers, planters began to use more slave labor. Congress had made bringing slaves into the United States illegal in 1808. However, the growing demand for slaves led to an increase in the slave trade within the United States.<br />

He believed that southern cotton was one of the most valuable resources in the world. Southern cotton was used to make cloth in England and the North. Many southerners shared Hammond’s viewpoints about cotton. Professor David Christy used colorful language to describe the crop’s importance.</p>

Southerners also sold tons of cotton to the growing textile industry in the northeastern United States. This increased trade led to the growth of major port cities in the South, including Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>

Farmers sold their cotton to merchants, who then made deals with the factors. Merchants and factors also arranged loans for farmers who needed to buy supplies. They often advised farmers on how to invest profits. Once farmers got their cotton to the port cities, factors arranged for transportation aboard trading ships.</p>

The few major road projects at the time were limited to the Southeast. Most southern farmers had to ship their goods on the region’s rivers. On the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, flatboats and steamboats carried cotton and other products to port. Eventually, hundreds of steamboats traveled up and down the mighty Mississippi River each day.</p>
