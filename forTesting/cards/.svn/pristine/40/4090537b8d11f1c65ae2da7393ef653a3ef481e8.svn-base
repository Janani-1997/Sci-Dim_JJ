        <p data-uuid="d10d885636934027a8fc2a1fcbd727ba">In 1792 President Washington gave command of the army in the West to General Anthony Wayne. Wayne’s task was to bring troops to the frontier to fight against the Native Americans. In 1793 General Wayne arrived in Ohio. Many of his men were ill from smallpox and influenza, so they were unable to fight well.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c027e709254f4535a52356a5285e7c17">Wayne’s troops moved north and built Fort Greenville, where they remained during the winter. They built additional forts for protection and to have supplies at hand.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4543fc26142d47d2a3f867cc47babe83">As the summer of 1794 neared, several Native American groups led by Little Turtle attacked a supply train near the fort. Wayne and his men responded. They attacked Native American towns and burned crops.</p>
        <p data-uuid="769cb60bbaf14b0998a2a17ec9a4dab1">Little Turtle's attempt to capture Fort Recovery in 1794 also failed. After this defeat, the British no longer aided the Native Americans, and Little Turtle realized that he was outmatched. He urged his people to seek peace.</p>

The battle was named for an area where many trees had been destroyed by a tornado. Wayne’s forces burned Native Americans’ villages and fields.
