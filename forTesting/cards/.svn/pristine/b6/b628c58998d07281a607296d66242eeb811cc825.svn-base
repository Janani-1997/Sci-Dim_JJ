        <p data-uuid="1a1ed6f04528452eb599e8377f507397">The economic recession that followed the war led to increased racial tensions. Many white laborers feared the competition for jobs. Several race riots broke out. In 1919 a race riot in Chicago left 38 dead. This riot was considered the worst of the approximately 25 riots that occurred during the Red Summer of 1919. In 1921 a group of whites attacked a community of African Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This resulted in the businesses and homes of the Greenwood District being destroyed. At that time, the Greenwood District was the wealthiest black community in the United States. <br />

        <p data-uuid="b8a9c1426dfc4a09a875f5fdbc739d2b">The Silent Parade, also called the Silent March or the Silent Protest Parade, happened on July 28, 1917, in New York City. The parade was partially a response to the East St. Louis riots in May and July 1917. White mobs killed between 40 and 250 blacks in these riots. In the Silent Parade, between 8,000 and 10,000 African Americans marched. They protested lynching and anti-black violence. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, organized the parade. This was one of the first parades of this kind in New York City. It was also one of the first instances of blacks publicly demonstrating for civil rights.</p>
        <p data-uuid="817cfa17b11948ec82d27949c98b112f"> Racial tensions and fear of foreigners helped give rise to a new form of the Ku Klux Klan. This racist group had terrorized African Americans during Reconstruction. The new Klan harassed Catholics, Jews, and immigrants, as well as African Americans. It also worked against urbanization, women’s rights, and modern technology. By the mid-1920s the Klan had more than 5 million members. It had become an influential force in American politics. Its influence then began to decline as news of financial corruption became public.<br />

        <p data-uuid="30cc350edfa74960882f7e73bcf9f573">People who were the targets of the Klan’s hatred found new ways to protect their rights. In 1922, for example, the NAACP began placing advertisements in newspapers. The ads presented the harsh facts about the large number of lynchings taking place across the South.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c040d7c5ce0b45918eab20bffd62f1b8"> Another way minorities tried to protect their rights was to strengthen their culture. During the 1910s and 1920s, <dfn title="Garvey, Marcus">Marcus Garvey</dfn> encouraged black people around the world to express pride in their culture. Garvey argued that black people should build their own businesses and communities to establish economic independence. These ideas were the basis of a movement known as black nationalism. The <i>New York Amsterdam News</i> praised Garvey’s work, saying he “made black people proud of their race.”<br />

A talented speaker, he quickly became one of the country’s most famous and controversial black leaders. His newspaper <i>Negro World</i> promoted the idea of building an independent black economy. To encourage worldwide trade among black people, he created the Black Star Steamship Line. Some black leaders, including W.E.B. Du Bois, considered Garvey’s ideas dangerous and extremist. After a series of legal problems related to his steamship company, Garvey was arrested in 1922 and was later deported.</p>

        <p data-uuid="82562ccc85cb4926b73b24d3bdb621fd">Hispanic Americans also organized to fight prejudice and promote civil rights. In 1929 Mexican American leaders met in Corpus Christi, Texas, to form the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). This group worked to end unfair treatment such as segregation in schools and voting restrictions.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5de93bdd2ca2400ba6ef694750ff702d"> Most Native Americans lacked the legal protections of citizenship and the right to vote because they were not citizens of the United States. The fact that thousands of Native Americans had performed military service in World War I helped bring about change. In 1924 Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act. The act granted citizenship to all Native Americans. However, the federal government also attempted to buy or take back some of the reservation lands. Native Americans successfully organized to stop these attempts, which were part of a larger effort to encourage Indians to adopt the culture of white Americans.<br />
