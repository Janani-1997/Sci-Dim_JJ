            Moctezuma
            ruled the Aztec Empire, which was at the height of its power in the early
            1500s. Moctezuma’s capital, Tenochtitl&#225;n, was built in the middle of Lake Texcoco,
            near the present-day site of Mexico City. Tenochtitl&#225;n was a large city with
            temples, a palace, and buildings that were built on an island in the middle of
            the lake. The buildings and riches of the city impressed the Spaniards. They
            saw the Aztec Empire as a good source of gold and silver. They also wanted to
            convert the Aztec to Christianity.</p>

            Aztec had thousands of warriors. In contrast, Cort&#233;s had only 508 soldiers,
            about 100 sailors, 16 horses, and some guns. Cort&#233;s hoped that his superior
            weapons would bring him victory. Cort&#233;s also sought help from enemies of the
            Aztec. An Indian woman named Malintzin (mah-LINT-suhn) helped Cort&#233;s win
            allies.</p>

            was destroyed and Moctezuma was killed. Smallpox and other diseases brought by

            than 400 men in his army. But the Inca, like the Aztec, had no weapons to match
            the conquistadors’ swords and guns. Though outnumbered, Pizarro’s troops
            captured the great Inca capital at Cuzco in present-day Peru and killed the
            Inca leaders. By 1534 Pizarro and his Native American allies had conquered the

            and looted their settlements. Moreover, possibly more than three-quarters of
            the Aztec and Inca populations were killed by the diseases the Europeans
            brought.<br />

        </h3>
        <p data-uuid="64ecefd9b02e4fe9890cf02ace7cfd64">The Spanish began to
            settle their vast empire, which they called New Spain. Spain’s government
            wanted to control migration to the Americas. Most of the emigrants were
            Spanish, though a few non-Spanish subjects of the king also migrated. Jews,
            Muslims, and non-Christians were forbidden to settle in New Spain. At first,
            most emigrants were men. The government then encouraged families to migrate.
            Eventually, women comprised one-quarter of the total emigration from Spain.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ec7a8bcaf2a244ca8a2cd1afae7c881e">Spain ruled its large
            American empire through a system of royal officials. At the top was the Council
            of&#160;the Indies, formed in 1524 to govern the Americas from Spain. The
            Council appointed two viceroys, or royal governors. The Viceroyalty of Peru
            governed most of South America. The Viceroyalty of New Spain governed all
            Spanish territories in Central America, Mexico, and the southern part of what
            is now the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1954e4d5174243f6b43ceb08f639a88b">The Spanish
            established three kinds of settlements in New Spain. Pueblos served as trading
            posts and sometimes as centers of government. Priests started missions, where
            they converted local Native Americans to Catholicism. The Spanish also built
            presidios, or military bases, to protect towns and missions.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d4f34e430b62426f95fa745feb0f9800">
            To
            connect some of the scattered communities of New Spain, Spanish settlers built
            <i>El Camino Real</i>, or “the Royal Road.” This network of roads ran for hundreds of
            miles, from Mexico City to Santa Fe. The roads later stretched to settlements
            in California.</p>
