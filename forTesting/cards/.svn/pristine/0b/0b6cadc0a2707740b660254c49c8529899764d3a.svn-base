        <p data-uuid="dd8c9e404fc04956b7562ac6bfa548d7">The war ended after Scott took Mexico City. In February 1848 the United States and Mexico signed the <dfn title="Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</dfn>, which officially ended the war and forced Mexico to turn over much of its northern territory to the United States. Known as the Mexican Cession, this land included the present-day states of California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bfa45dc04f7d4dc0a47c72dd868d93af"> In addition, it included most of Arizona and New Mexico and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. The United States also won the area claimed by Texas north of the Rio Grande. The Mexican Cession totaled more than 500,000 square miles and increased the size of the United States by almost 25 percent.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="67ee96c6a53747f6a6735f4e53ee669c">Diplomatic Agreements and Payments</h3>
        <p data-uuid="5ade9fab5fe4495ba86aaee72ed87d16">In exchange for this vast territory, the United States agreed to pay Mexico $15 million. In addition, the United States assumed claims of more than $3 million held by American citizens against the Mexican government. The treaty also addressed the status of Mexicans in the Mexican Cession. The treaty provided that they would be “protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property, and secured in the free exercise of their religion.” The Senate passed the treaty in March 1848.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dfdc35dadf964eadab8d002a3079c690"> After the war with Mexico, some Americans wanted to guarantee that any southern railroad to California would be built completely on American soil. James Gadsden, U.S. minister to Mexico, negotiated an important diplomatic agreement with Mexico in December 1853. Under the terms of the <dfn title="Gadsden Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</dfn>, the U.S. government paid Mexico $10 million. In exchange, the United States received the southern parts of what are now Arizona and New Mexico. With this purchase, the existing boundary with Mexico was finally fixed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6c03ecd21d074b2e982339fbe00b527e">In less than seven years, the United States acquired approximately 50 percent of Mexico’s territory that included Texas, the Mexican Cession, and the Gadsden Purchase.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="332873235f484cd4af41189ed1fe11e2">Surge of American Settlers</h3>
        <p data-uuid="78975a8fbaba4466918aa431417c5fca">After the Mexican-American War, a flood of Americans moved to the Southwest. Their movement sparked a new debate about slavery in the United States. Many southerners who moved west wanted to bring slaves with them into the new territories.</p>
        <p data-uuid="43dac7df3a8e4825bdeccbacb569ee75">Northerners who opposed slavery wanted to ban the practice in the new lands. Even before the war had ended, northern senator David Wilmot proposed a policy, called the Wilmot Proviso. His policy would have banned slavery in all lands gained from Mexico. The proviso was defeated in Congress, but debates about slavery in the Mexican Cession continued for several years.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8a45bb0740ab4e088f3a9e71974db04c"> American newcomers struggled against longtime residents to control the land and other valuable resources, such as water and minerals. Most Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans faced legal, economic, and social discrimination. As a result, they found it difficult to protect their rights.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e01849b4f399401497f1b4d28f6c0744">The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo promised full U.S. citizenship to all Mexicans who wished to stay in the new American lands. However, many of those who stayed faced discrimination. Even Mexican Americans who were already living in Texas, some of whom had fought against Mexico, faced challenges. For example, differences between Mexican and U.S. land laws led to great confusion. The U.S. government often made Mexican American landowners go to court to prove that they had titles to their land. Landowners had to pay their own travel costs as well as those of witnesses and interpreters. They also had to pay attorneys’ and interpreters’ fees. These legal battles often bankrupted landowners. New settlers also tended to ignore Mexican legal concepts, such as community property or community water rights.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5b5cd8a7b2784afdaca3ef0d108fcb72">White settlers also battled with Native Americans over property rights. In some areas, for example, new white settlers soon outnumbered southwestern Native Americans. The Anglo settlers often tried to take control of valuable water resources and grazing lands. In addition, settlers rarely respected Native American holy places. Native American peoples such as the Navajo and the Apache tried to protect their land and livestock from the settlers. Settlers and Native Americans alike attacked one another to protect their interests.<br />

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="104121cb2bcb497c9ec70c98a186be5e">Despite conflicts, different cultures shaped one another in the Southwest. In settlements with large Mexican populations, laws were often printed in both English and Spanish. Names of places—such as San Antonio, San Diego, and Santa Barbara—show Hispanic heritage. Other place-names, such as Taos and Tesuque, are derived from Native American words. Communities throughout the Southwest regularly celebrated both Mexican and American holidays.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4d540d49db284c29a5fed7d9b563a5aa">Mexican and Native American knowledge and traditions also shaped many local economies. Mexican Americans taught Anglo settlers about mining in the mountains. Many ranching communities were first started by Mexican settlers. In addition, Mexican Americans introduced new types of saddles and other equipment to American ranchers. Adobe, developed by the Anasazi Indians, was adopted from the Pueblo people by the Spanish. It is still commonly used by American residents in New Mexico, Arizona, and California.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cdc527cdded14b5492bc2076e128aebf"> Trade also changed the Southwest. For example, the Navajo created handwoven woolen blankets to sell to Americans. Americans in turn brought manufactured goods and money to the Southwest. The city of El Paso became an important regional trading center. As trade increased after the Mexican-American War, the economies of many Mexican American and Native American communities in the Southwest began to change. </p>

        <p data-uuid="0eef21bf2bb34e5c97a3ba19719b8762">Eastern water-use laws commonly required owners whose land bordered streams or rivers to maintain a free flow of water. These restrictions generally prevented landowners from constructing dams because doing so would infringe upon the water rights of neighbors downstream.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f55c5c973d2d4361b4aaa3d4bd85fbb3">In the typically dry climate of the West, large-scale agriculture was not possible without irrigation. Dams and canals were required to direct scarce water to fields. This need conflicted with the accepted eastern tradition of equal access to water.</p>
        <p data-uuid="16cb0a6ae517441ab97ce755addea941"> Brigham Young established a strict code regulating water rights for the Mormon community. In any dispute over water use, the good of the community would outweigh the interests of individuals. Young’s approach stood as an example for modern water laws throughout the West. <br />
