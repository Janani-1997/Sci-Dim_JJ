            company, hoping to earn money from their investment. The middle class is a

            Native Americans after Smith made an agreement with them. The Powhatan traded
            food for tools and pots to help the colonists. They also taught the colonists

            to view the settlers as invaders who would take over their land. In the winter
            of 1609–1610, the Powhatan surrounded the Jamestown fort and killed anyone who
            tried to reach supplies outside.</p>

            That

            period the starving time. By the spring of 1610, only 60 colonists were still
            alive. Jamestown failed to make a profit until colonist John Rolfe introduced a
            new type of tobacco that sold well in England.</p>

            canceled the company’s charter in 1624. Virginia became a royal colony and
