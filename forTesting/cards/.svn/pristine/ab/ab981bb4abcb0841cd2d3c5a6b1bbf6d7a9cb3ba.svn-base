        <p data-uuid="e958f2533f4e4c4b88c8a26c9fba1bb0">On June 17, 1972, five men were arrested
            while breaking into the Democratic National Committee’s offices at the
            Watergate Hotel in Washington, DC. The burglars were carrying camera equipment
            and secret recording devices. Police soon discovered that some of them had ties
            to the Nixon administration. One had worked for the Committee to Reelect the
            President (CRP).</p>
        <p data-uuid="c32259117fab46bdbb26d0b9fa16b256">
            Nixon denied that anyone in his administration was involved in the
            Watergate break-in, and the White House public relations campaign was
            successful in keeping the trust of the American people. Nixon went on to win
            the 1972 election in a landslide. But early in Nixon’s second term, the
            seemingly minor break-in exploded into a massive political scandal that became
            known as <b><dfn title="Watergate">Watergate</dfn></b>.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="6f5b0d0521ba4a7ba00267daa7344b45">Investigating the Break-in</h3>
        <p data-uuid="8a5ea75c4c3942f99130a551e65931a9">Did Nixon administration officials have
            anything to do with the Watergate break-in? Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl
            Bernstein investigated that question in a series of articles in the <i>Washington</i>
            <i>Post</i>. Key figures in the Nixon administration refused to talk to the
            reporters. Then a government official contacted Woodward. The official had
            inside information on the Watergate investigation. The informant was not
            revealed until 2005, more than 30 years later. W. Mark Felt, second-in-command
            at the FBI during Watergate, was the inside source. However, at the time,
            Woodward called Felt by a secret codename to protect his identity. </p>
        <p data-uuid="8084a52dba1a46c59122f311f71fb024">
            With the information they received from Felt, Woodward and Bernstein
            began publishing stories about Nixon administration officials and their illegal
            activities. The stories revealed that the CRP had hidden illegal campaign
            contributions and spread false rumors about Democratic candidates. They also
            presented evidence that officials in the Nixon White House were trying to cover
            up the facts of the Watergate break-in.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f88cbc2a446c4fccb1ed699364640864">Senator Sam Ervin led a Senate committee that
            launched its own investigation of Watergate. When the committee began televised
            hearings in May 1973, millions of Americans tuned in. The most damaging witness
            was former White House attorney John Dean. He testified that Nixon was
            personally involved in the Watergate cover-up. Dean could not prove this,
            however. Then another witness, former White House staffer Alexander
            Butterfield, revealed that Nixon had tape-recorded almost all of his Oval
            Office conversations.</p>
        <p data-uuid="755511a36fc747dc8ac28be67e6c8bcd">Committee members asked Nixon to allow them
            to listen to the tapes. Nixon refused to hand the tapes over to a special
            prosecutor. He claimed executive privilege—a president’s right to keep
            information secret for reasons of national security. In July 1974 the Supreme
            Court ordered Nixon to turn over the tapes. The recordings proved that Nixon
            had directed the Watergate cover-up and lied about it to Congress and the
            public.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5322a6bc37d94fe0ab85c92227d01e74">
            While this investigation was unfolding, Vice President Spiro Agnew
            resigned. He faced charges that he had taken bribes and failed to pay taxes.
            Nixon appointed Michigan congressman <b><dfn title="Ford, Gerald">Gerald
            Ford</dfn></b> as vice president.<br />

        <p data-uuid="94e8225f564745629397aba4a8df4275">On August 8, 1974, Nixon appeared on national
            television. He announced, “I shall resign the presidency effective at noon
            tomorrow.” Nixon became the first president in American history to resign from
            office. Gerald Ford was sworn in as president on August 9.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7d20d3e91d674bd4a9574b74a0c8d3a8">
            One of the consequences of Watergate was that many Americans lost faith
            in government officials. In a poll taken in 1974, just 36 percent of Americans
            said they trusted the government. Others, however, saw a more positive side of
            Watergate. Senator Sam Ervin viewed the hearings and Nixon’s resignation as
            evidence that the government was able to rid itself of corruption. “Watergate .
            . . proved our Constitution works,” he said.<br />
