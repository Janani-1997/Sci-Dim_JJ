        <p data-uuid="08bd8ae1016147f5bc4b83bfcc4b63f2">Desperate to end the hard
            times, many people were willing to give up their individual rights to leaders
            who promised to deliver prosperity and national glory. As a result, in the
            1920s and 1930s, several European countries moved toward <b><dfn title="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</dfn></b>, a political system in which the government
            controls every aspect of citizens’ lives. These governments were inspired by
            militant nationalism to expand their territory and power.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a602ec55dfc047e88b468482a5cd244d">Italy</h3>
        <p data-uuid="73862be55a4c4eacab90da16b6285665">In the years after World War I, the people of
            Italy suffered through economic depression, unemployment, strikes, and riots.
            Many Italians looked for a strong leader who could bring stability to the
            country. They found such a leader in <b><dfn title="Mussolini, Benito">Benito
            Mussolini</dfn></b>, who gained complete control of Italy in 1922. Mussolini’s
            rule was based on <b><dfn title="fascism">fascism</dfn></b>, a
            political system in which the “state”—or government—is seen as more important
            than individuals. Fascist systems are typically militaristic and headed by a
            strong leader. </p>
        <p data-uuid="0b9bd429a97649a5b4078a9c178f898a">
            Mussolini restored order to Italy and improved the
            economy through public works projects. But the fascist government violently
            crushed all opposition, destroying basic individual rights such as freedom of
            speech. In 1935 Mussolini tried to expand Italy’s territory by attacking the
            nation of Ethiopia, making it a colony. Haile Selassie, Ethiopia’s overthrown
            emperor, warned the world, “It is us today. It will be you tomorrow.”<br />

        <p data-uuid="94dfab6190864883bfe853ca07510cc7">Germany was also suffering the effects of the
            global depression. In addition, many Germans were furious about the Treaty of
            Versailles, which forced Germany to make crippling reparation payments for its
            role in World War I. Politician, World War I veteran, and militant nationalist <b><dfn title="Hitler, Adolf">Adolf Hitler</dfn></b> took advantage of
            public anger to gain power. A fiery speaker, he inspired huge audiences by
            vowing to restore Germany to prosperity and a position of international power. </p>
        <p data-uuid="ed03cc8cd12a4ba9aa0e30093998e7b6">
            Hitler also offered Germans a scapegoat, or someone
            to blame for their problems. He accused intellectuals, Communists, and
            especially Jews of causing Germany’s defeat in World War I and its economic
            problems after the war. Only by ridding itself of Jews, Hitler declared, would
            Germany again rise to greatness. Hitler’s National Socialist Party, or <b><dfn title="Nazis">Nazis</dfn></b>, gained a large following.
            Hitler became chancellor in 1933 and quickly seized all government power. Hitler’s
            Nazi state became known as the Third Reich.<br />

            hatred of communism. But he had something in common with the Communist ruler of
            the Soviet Union—both ruled as ruthless dictators. By 1928 <b><dfn title="Stalin, Joseph">Joseph Stalin</dfn></b> had become dictator of the Soviet Union. In
            the 1930s Stalin terrorized those he saw as political enemies, killing or
            imprisoning millions of Soviet citizens. As one Soviet artist put it, “There
            isn’t a single thinking adult in this country who hasn’t thought that he might
            get shot.”

        <p data-uuid="494f86ca67ec464ea95012306070138e">Though Japan never had one
            single dictator, a group of nationalist military leaders slowly gained complete
            control over the government during the early 1900s. By the early 1930s this
            group had more influence than the Japanese emperor. The military leaders wanted
            to build a large Japanese empire in East Asia. In 1931 Japan invaded and
            conquered a region in northern China and called it Manchukuo. China’s capital,
            Nanjing, was the site of massacres that claimed up to 300,000 Chinese victims.
            (Between 1937 and 1945 Japan’s invasion of China would cost some 20 million
            lives.) The United States protested the invasion. Fearful of another world war,
            however, most Americans opposed using force to help China. The League of
            Nations also condemned Japan for the attack but was unable to take forceful
            action.<br />
