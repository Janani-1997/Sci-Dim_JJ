            events could have a serious impact on life in the United States. Henry
            Kissinger, a German American professor who became Nixon’s senior foreign policy
            adviser, helped Nixon develop a new approach to foreign policy. Nixon’s foreign
            policy decisions would be based on practical American interests, not on moral
            or political ideals. This approach was known as <dfn title="realpolitik">realpolitik</dfn>, the German term meaning “actual politics.”</p>

            <p data-uuid="ccfd2d20757b4a2ca67f0a164b6b99a2">President Nixon appointed Henry
                Kissinger to the position of Secretary of State in 1973. Kissinger was the only
                person who ever served as both Secretary of State and National Security
                Advisor.</p>
            <p data-uuid="be7bc41178394e18a945d07062756485">In 1938 Kissinger’s family, which
                was Jewish, fled Nazi Germany for the United States. Kissinger became a
                naturalized citizen during World War II. During the war, he served as a German
                interpreter for the army.</p>
            <p data-uuid="7d5b7a82cbfb4447a2b58d2f9a3d9657">Kissinger was a strong supporter of
                Israel. He made certain Israel received the weapons it needed after the
                surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973.</p>
            <p data-uuid="30f79b35c70e4d4fb2d7eff5aed3bbf7">
                After a ceasefire was announced, Kissinger began what
                was commonly called “shuttle diplomacy.” He traveled between different Middle
                East countries working to negotiate peace agreements. In early 1974 his efforts
                resulted in an agreement between Egypt and Israel. A few months later, Syria
                and Israel also signed an agreement.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c70844e2791f41d688c5624b373ecd1b">Nixon credited his realpolitik strategies
            with bringing an end to the Vietnam War. These strategies used political
            pressure from the Soviet Union and China to convince the North Vietnamese to
            negotiate. Realpolitik was controversial, however. In several Latin American
            countries, for example, the United States backed harsh military governments
            because they were friendly to U.S. interests.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cad2ca2b8bd44db0b4e0ba50a6601ee0">In the ongoing Cold War rivalries with China
            and the Soviet Union, the realpolitik approach led to important changes.
            American officials had long feared China and the Soviet Union would work
            together to spread communism. But by 1970 it was clear that these two Communist
            powers had become bitter rivals. One cause of this rivalry was the Cultural
            Revolution. Chinese leader Mao Zedong launched this campaign in 1966 to regain
            control of his country’s government. Mao and his allies attempted to rid China
            of capitalist and traditional influences. Millions of Chinese people were
            persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. In addition to attacking his
            internal enemies, Mao accused Soviet leaders of betraying the ideals of
            communism by being too “soft” in their policies dealing with capitalist
            countries.</p>

            Nixon believed
            it was in America’s interest to widen this split and to improve U.S. relations with both Communist powers. He first turned his attention to
            China. Nixon lifted restrictions on trade and travel and opened negotiations.
            In 1972 Nixon became the first U.S. president to make an official visit to
            China. His visit received wide acclaim in the media. Newscasts showed Nixon and
            Mao shaking hands and trading jokes during their meeting.
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="bfe29ac70050415da2f2e590140aed79">Nixon’s trip led to improved U.S.-China
            relations. It also caught the attention of Soviet leaders. They became more
            open to talks with the United States. In May 1972 Nixon flew to Moscow, where
            he and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev participated in the <dfn title="Strategic Arms Limitation Talks">Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</dfn> (SALT).<br />
