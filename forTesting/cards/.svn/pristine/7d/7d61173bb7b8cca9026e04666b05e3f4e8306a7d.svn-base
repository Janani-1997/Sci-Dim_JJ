            over the Constitution</h3>
        <p data-uuid="ceaaf73b02294bbeaadcfab0a56e7610">When the Constitution was made public, a huge debate began
            among many Americans. Some <dfn title="Antifederalists">Antifederalists</dfn>—people who opposed the Constitution—thought
            that the Constitutional Convention should not have created a new government.
            Others, such as James Monroe, thought the Constitution weakened states’ rights
            by giving too much power to the central government.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="24a9523a74e64a6593a84c306e761d2a">For some Antifederalists,
            including <dfn title="Mason, George">George Mason</dfn>, the main
            problem was that the Constitution did not have a section that guaranteed
            individual rights. In 1776 Mason had drafted the Virginia Bill of Rights, which asserted<span>&#160;</span>“that all men are by nature equally free and independent.” Thomas Jefferson, who was otherwise in favor of the
            Constitution, wrote to Madison from Paris to argue that a bill of rights was
            needed. </p>

            Patriots, including Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, were also strong
            Antifederalists. At the Virginia ratifying convention, Henry spoke out against
            the lack of protection of individual freedoms, saying that he valued American
            liberty over American union.<br />

            Constitution that offered a good balance of power between various political
            views. Many Federalists were wealthy planters, farmers, and lawyers. However,
            others were workers and craftspeople.</p>

            Constitution should be approved. Moreover, the Federalists took swift action to convince people that a change in the structure of government was needed. They also had to overcome people's fears that the Constitution would make the
            government too powerful. Toward this end, Federalists made speeches and printed pamphlets advocating
            their views. Mercy Otis Warren, an ardent Patriot during the war, wrote a
            pamphlet entitled <i>Observations on the New Constitution</i>, in which she
            criticized the lack of individual rights it provided.&#160;<br />
