            as <b><dfn title="superpowers">superpowers</dfn></b>, or powerful
            countries, who influenced events in their regions of the world. During World
            War II, the two countries had cooperated to win the war. Afterward, the
            differences between the two nations led to new hostility. The Soviet Union
            hoped to spread communism around the world. Americans remained committed to
            capitalism and democracy.</p>

        <p data-uuid="0cea3e90dc834c39b954e28b551d94c7">
            After Stalin created a Communist government in
            Poland, the Soviet Union expanded its control over Eastern Europe by creating
            “satellite states”—countries under complete Soviet control. In 1946 Winston
            Churchill described how Soviet control cut these countries off from the Western
            world. “An iron curtain has descended [fallen] across the [European]
            Continent,” he said. The term <i>iron curtain</i> thus came to be used to
            describe this division. Presidential adviser Bernard Baruch warned of the
            seriousness of the Soviet threat, saying, “Let us not be deceived—we are today
            in the midst of a cold war.” The phrase <b><dfn title="Cold War">Cold
            War</dfn></b> came to be used to describe the struggle for global power between
            the United States and the Soviet Union.&#160;<br />

            Policies</h3>
        <p data-uuid="e099ab71cfd7434ca5b328722ad1a70b">The United States quickly developed a new foreign policy to deal
            with the Cold War. It was based on the goal of <b><dfn title="containment">containment</dfn></b>, or preventing the Soviet Union from expanding its
            influence around the world.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e327e081f4c44cb4ae47aec4728c5a7d">In 1945 the Soviet Union began demanding control over areas in the
            Mediterranean Sea that were under Turkish authority. In 1946 Communist rebels
            in Greece threatened to topple the Greek monarchy. At Truman’s request,
            Congress passed an aid package worth millions of dollars for Greece and Turkey.
            The money, the president said, would “support free peoples who are resisting
            attempted subjugation [conquest] by armed minorities or outside pressures.”
            U.S. aid helped the Greek army defeat the Communist rebels and protected Turkey
            from Soviet expansion. This policy of providing aid to help foreign countries
            fight communism became known as the <dfn title="Truman Doctrine">Truman
            Doctrine</dfn>.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e0c985fcd3084cb1896682e2a4d0a97c">The nations of Europe, meanwhile, were still devastated from World
            War&#160;II. American secretary of state George C. Marshall saw this as a
            threat both to stability in Europe and to the U.S. economy, which depended on
            trade with Europe. Marshall called on European leaders to develop plans for
            economic recovery, which the United States would help fund. Under the <dfn title="Marshall Plan">Marshall<b> </b>Plan</dfn>, Western Europe received
            more than $13 billion in U.S. loans and grants for European economic recovery
            between 1948 and 1952. Soviet leaders rejected Marshall Plan aid. They also
            kept Eastern European nations from participating.</p>

        <p data-uuid="bf2d8d6d4273402aa8f80261e7aa91b0">Japan was also left devastated by World War II. With the end of
            the war, U.S. forces under General Douglas MacArthur occupied Japan and began a
            series of reforms to help rebuild the country and to keep communism from taking
            hold. As part of the reform, Japan’s emperor lost most of his authority. Power
            was given instead to an elected parliament. The Americans also helped
            strengthen and modernize the Japanese economy.</p>

            Cold War tensions rose further in 1948 when
            France, Britain, and the United States decided to join their occupation zones
            of Germany into one unit. The Soviet Union had good reason to fear the creation
            of a strong West German state. On June 24, the Soviet Union suddenly blocked
            all rail, highway, and water traffic between western Germany and the city of
            Berlin. West Berlin’s 2 million residents were trapped behind the iron curtain.<br />

        <p data-uuid="5032f61aa3704d10bb2360e1ebce2982">To respond to this crisis without using military force, U.S. and
            British planes began airlifting supplies into West Berlin. For more than a
            year, planes delivered lifesaving food, fuel, and machinery to West Berliners.
            The Soviet Union made no determined effort to stop the airlift, fearing a war.
            It then lifted the blockade in May 1949.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6d4e2560dd6b4292b810f5fe62b4fe26">
            That same year, the United States joined nine
            Western European countries, along with Iceland and Canada, to form the <dfn title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</dfn>
            (NATO). NATO members promised to defend each other if attacked. In 1955 the
            Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact, which provided a unified system of
            military command between the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite
            countries for their mutual defense. When the Cold War ended, many former Warsaw
            Pact nations joined NATO. Today, NATO has 28 member nations.<br />
