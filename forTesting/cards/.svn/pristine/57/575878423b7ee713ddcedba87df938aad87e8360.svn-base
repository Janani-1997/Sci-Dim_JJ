The Emancipation Proclamation had freed slaves only in areas that had not been occupied by Union forces, not in the border states. Many people feared that the federal courts might someday declare the proclamation unconstitutional.</p>

A loophole, or an ambiguity of a law, existed. “Involuntary servitude,” according to this amendment, could be enforced as punishment for a crime. The amendment also failed to specify what the legal status of freedpeople would be or if they would be fully entitled to the rights of American citizens.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6cedc963342d4716b9d622abdc89f64c">The amendment was ratified and took effect on December 18, 1865. When abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison heard the news, he declared that his work was now finished. He called for the American Anti-Slavery Society to break up. Not all abolitionists agreed that their work was done, however. Frederick Douglass insisted that “slavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot [vote].”</p>
        <p data-uuid="b1da85e7d7cc43a0a49d83c8f2c81a9c">Freedom brought important changes to newly freed slaves. Many couples held ceremonies to legalize marriages that had not been recognized under slavery. Many freedpeople searched for relatives who had been sold away from their families years earlier. Others placed newspaper ads seeking information about their children. Many women began to work at home instead of in the fields. Still others adopted children of dead relatives to keep families together. Church members established voluntary associations and mutual-aid societies to help those in need.</p>

        <p data-uuid="39820d59aaf640e1bdb6ff07338342cf">Now that they could travel without a pass, many freedpeople moved from mostly white counties to places with more African Americans. Other freedpeople traveled simply to test their new freedom of movement. Northern migration, while not as extensive as the coming World War I Great Migration beginning in 1910, significantly increased the urban black population of the North. Detroit’s African American population, for instance, more than doubled during the 1860s, with the vast majority of its new arrivals coming from the South. A South Carolina woman explained this need. “I must go, if I stay here I’ll never know I’m free.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="1ca98bde5a194743aae65b51221772ef">For most former slaves, freedom to travel was just the first step on a long road toward equal rights and new ways of life. Adults took new last names and began to insist on being called Mr. or Mrs. as a sign of respect, rather than by their first names or by nicknames. Freedpeople began to demand the same economic and political rights as white citizens. Henry Adams, a former slave, argued that “if I cannot do like a white man I am not free.”</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="fb0e3d23dcae4027b84db8edeb0b2c06">Forty Acres to Farm?</h3>
        <p data-uuid="25a246526f91485ab7b16cda6dcfa973">Many former slaves wanted their own land to farm. Near the end of the Civil War, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman had issued an order to break up plantations in coastal South Carolina and Georgia. He wanted to divide the land into 40-acre plots and give them to former slaves as compensation for their forced labor before the war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b42b122698764313ab25842ebb964ede">Many white planters refused to surrender their land. Some freedpeople pointed out that it was only fair that they receive some of this land because their labor had made the plantations prosper. In the end, the U.S. government returned the land to its original owners. At this time, many freedpeople were unsure about where they would live, what kind of work they would do, and what rights they had. Freedoms that were theirs by law were difficult to enforce.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="cee0692cf74f4b608b9878c92a7aecc4">Freedmen’s Bureau</h3>
        <p data-uuid="dc660c45a611445ebc07753244455e78">In 1865 Congress established the <b><dfn title="Freedmen’s Bureau">Freedmen’s Bureau</dfn></b>, an agency providing relief for freedpeople and certain poor people in the South. The bureau had a difficult job. At its high point, about 900 agents served the entire South. Bureau commissioner Oliver O. Howard eventually decided to use the bureau’s limited budget to distribute food to the poor and to provide education and legal help for freedpeople. The bureau also helped African American war veterans.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c58a530e311a4700a6af89576754a998"> The Freedmen’s Bureau played an important role in establishing more schools in the South. Laws against educating slaves meant that most freedpeople had never learned to read or write. Before the war ended, however, northern groups, such as the American Missionary Association, began providing books and teachers to African Americans. The teachers were mostly women who were committed to helping freedpeople. One teacher said of her students, “I never before saw children so eager to learn. . . . It is wonderful how [they] . . . can have so great a desire for knowledge, and such a capacity for attaining [reaching] it.”</p>

The Freedmen’s Bureau also built hospitals, provided medical services, supervised contracts between freedpeople and employers, and took care of lands abandoned or captured during the war.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d06d14b2d6f6495b8d02bf0b9723724d">After the war, some freedpeople organized their own education efforts. For example, Freedmen’s Bureau agents found that some African Americans had opened schools in abandoned buildings. Many white southerners continued to believe that African Americans should not be educated. Despite opposition, by 1869 more than 150,000 African American students were attending more than 3,000 schools. The Freedmen’s Bureau also helped establish a number of universities for African Americans, including Howard and Fisk universities. </p>
        <p data-uuid="37ae88b9124e4473a3d7a23b8b44533a"> Students quickly filled the new classrooms. Working adults attended classes in the evening. African Americans hoped that education would help them to understand and protect their rights and to enable them to find better jobs. Both black and white southerners benefited from the effort to provide greater access to education in the South.</p>
