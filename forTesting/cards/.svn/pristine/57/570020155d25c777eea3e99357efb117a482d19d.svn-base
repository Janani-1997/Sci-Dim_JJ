Their main objection was the League of Nations’ power to use military force. They were worried that as a member of the league, the United States could be forced to send troops to war based on decisions made by the League of Nations. This, they argued, conflicted with Congress’s constitutional power to declare war.<br />

Wilson demanded that Democrats in the Senate refuse to change the treaty. When the vote was taken on November 19, 1919, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans would compromise. The Treaty of Versailles was defeated in the Senate. Following extensive political debate, the United States refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
