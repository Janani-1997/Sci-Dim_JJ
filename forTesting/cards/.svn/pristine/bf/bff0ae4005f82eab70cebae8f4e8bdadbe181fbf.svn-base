Progressives tried to solve problems caused by rapid industrial and urban growth. They wanted to eliminate the causes of problems such as crime, disease, and poverty. They fought for reforms ranging from better working conditions to education programs in poor neighborhoods.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3ba6cd0ad58a438e8c74f393beb883b8">Some journalists urged Progressives to action by writing stories that vividly described problems in society. These journalists were nicknamed <b><dfn title="muckrakers">muckrakers</dfn></b> because they “raked up” and exposed the muck, or filth, of society. Muckrakers wrote about troubling issues such as child labor, racial discrimination, living conditions in housing slums, and corruption in business and politics.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6853d9f8f9e346dbad0bca3c9b08c284"> In 1902 and 1903 Lincoln Steffens wrote a series of articles in <i>McClure’s</i>&#160;magazine exposing corruption in city government. In one article, he described how government officials in St. Louis, Missouri, used their positions to earn extra money illegally:</p>

Later that same year, the U.S. government passed the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act. Many Americans even gave up eating meat for a while.</p>

There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man would run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. . . . There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="cc25aeb748dc4b1d9fa4c4d282e42a75">A major goal of Progressive reformers was to help the urban poor. Some Progressives started settlement houses similar to Jane Addams’s Hull House. People usually started settlement houses in poor areas in order to improve education, housing, and sanitation there. Jacob Riis, a newspaper reporter, made Americans aware of the extremes of poverty suffered by working people by describing the tenement houses where immigrants lived in New York City. Riis believed that every human being deserved a decent, safe place to live. His book <i>How the Other Half Lives</i> led to reforms and new laws that improved housing conditions, such as the 1901 New York State Tenement House Act.</p>

The book was a collection of photographs of residents and workers in New York City tenement buildings, including families and immigrants. The conditions of life that Riis showed in his photographs, like this sweatshop workplace, shocked many wealthier Americans, who then used their influence to push for reforms.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d3851934a7e94d859cbe635ce2d85aa2">The movement for urban reform also led to new professions. City planners helped design safer building codes and opened new public parks. Civil engineers improved transportation by paving streets and building bridges. Sanitation engineers tried to solve problems concerning pollution, waste disposal, and impure water supplies. Death rates dropped dramatically in areas where planners and engineers addressed these problems.</p>
        <p data-uuid="abe2b1754ed44aa49c386b219ac05fc5"> Progressives also believed that improving education would lead to a better society. In response to their demands, states passed laws requiring all children to attend school. Some Progressives started kindergarten programs to help young city children learn basic social skills. In 1873 reformer Susan Blow opened the first American public kindergarten in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1883 Lucy Craft Laney founded the first kindergarten for African American children in Augusta, Georgia. By 1898 more than 4,000 kindergartens had opened in the United States.</p>

She was born in 1854 before slavery was abolished in the United States. Her parents, however, were free. Laney’s father had purchased his and his wife’s freedom years before Lucy was born. </p>
            <p data-uuid="5cdf524f171541c78a3cbd6ffdd0ab34">Laney was a gifted learner. She had learned to read and write by the age of 4 and by the age of 12 could translate Latin. In 1873 Laney graduated from normal school (teacher’s training) at Atlanta University. After years of teaching, “Miss Lucy,” as she was commonly known, started her own school in 1883 in a church basement in Augusta. The school was soon chartered by the state and named the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute.</p>
            <p data-uuid="da193eee694c48ceb2780e8bd2f790b1">By 1912 the Haines Institute had 34 teachers and 900 students. It was there Laney began Augusta’s first kindergarten for African American children and Augusta’s first nursing training programs for African American women.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ef5271e14a624b3b838038efec46dc85">John Dewey was a key supporter of early childhood education. His motive was to help children learn problem-solving skills, not just memorize facts. He thought this would help them in everyday life. Dewey’s teaching methods became a model for progressive education across the country.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d6310b08c0c5495db51721326971c771">Progressives also worked to improve the education of doctors and nurses. In the late 1800s there were not enough well-trained and professionally organized doctors. Researchers knew the causes of diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. However, there were few medical organizations that could help spread this knowledge.</p>
        <p data-uuid="91ead5a9cf864bdeb5ea953b32f55904"> Under the leadership of Joseph McCormack, the American Medical Association (AMA) brought together local medical organizations in 1901. The AMA supported laws designed to protect public health and showed how Progressives could organize to help improve society. Other organizations followed the AMA’s lead.</p>
