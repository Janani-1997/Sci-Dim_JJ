        <p data-uuid="832e340203f74e188821f32d92e1fbfe">The Second Industrial Revolution was characterized by dramatic developments in the use and distribution of oil and electricity. These power sources fueled other changes.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="ba741dba074949bbb3d77da8aa07a50d">Oil as a Power Source</h3>
        <p data-uuid="685e0a712d3445be8a078588fbdbcaf8">Other important technological breakthroughs in the late 1800s led to the widespread use of petroleum, or oil, as a power source. In the 1850s scientists discovered an inexpensive way to convert crude, or unprocessed, oil into a fuel called kerosene that could be used to light lamps. Because kerosene was so affordable, people quickly put it to good use lighting their homes and businesses.</p>
        <p data-uuid="11f42e06ea474bc18405d5a1809d821b"> Not surprisingly, demand for oil skyrocketed and companies set out to discover new oil sources. Until this time, people had collected oil from seeps, places where oil naturally oozes from the ground. However, oil from seeps couldn’t keep up with demand. One company hired Edwin L. Drake, who believed he could access oil by drilling into the ground in Pennsylvania. At first people mocked Drake’s drilling efforts as “Drake’s Folly.” Then, in 1859 his crew hit an underground spring deep in the rock. The next day, oil seeped up and the crew scrambled to collect it in buckets, tubs, and barrels. Edwin Drake had drilled the first commercial oil well. He was soon steadily pumping “black gold” to the surface.</p>

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="db0421b5b1ad4192a67238501f268f2a">Edwin Drake’s oil well, located near Titusville, Pennsylvania, was the first petroleum oil well drilled in the United States.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8e4f75423f63487f9c5fd6b0842a8de2">The output from Drake’s well was modest, but it drew plenty of wildcatters, or oil prospectors, to Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Oil became a big business as these states began producing millions of barrels per year. Oil companies built refineries to turn the crude oil into finished products like kerosene. One oil company supervisor referred to oil workers as “men who are supplying light for the world.”</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="79ad1c9559d2445dbf61cc111af97e77">Electricity Spreads</h3>
        <p data-uuid="0bf8df00a46546ebbc595bc53dcf5f1d">In addition to kerosene, electricity became a critical source of light and power during the Second Industrial Revolution. The possible uses of electricity interested inventors like <b><dfn title="Edison, Thomas Alva">Thomas Edison</dfn></b>. In 1876 he founded the first modern research laboratory when he hired others with scientific talent and began what became known as an “invention factory“ in Menlo Park, New Jersey.<br />

        <p data-uuid="37f9572c5e59452ab32b85498a6971d6">Edison eventually held more than 1,000 <b><dfn title="patent">patents</dfn></b>, exclusive rights to make or sell inventions. Patents allowed inventors to protect their inventions from being manufactured by others.</p>
        <p data-uuid="41d8a6bab44d4891a48730ae29a91de5"> In 1878 Edison announced that he would soon invent a practical electric light. By the end of 1879, Edison and his team of inventors had created the electric light bulb. The public was excited. However, Edison had a problem. At the time, few homes or businesses could get electricity. Edison therefore built a power plant that began supplying electricity to dozens of New York City buildings in September 1882. The <i>New York Times</i> reported that with electric lighting in the newspaper offices, “it seemed almost like writing by daylight.” However, Edison’s equipment could not send electricity over long distances. As a result, his power company, Edison Electric, provided electricity mainly to central cities.<br />

            <p data-uuid="5cd6fec193b2477f93424020faa55f64">Thomas Edison was probably one of the most tireless inventors in history. He invented and patented 1,093 inventions in the U.S.—the most patents that the U.S. Patent Office has ever granted to one person. It is rumored that Edison often worked 20 hours a day and slept for only 4 hours. He referred to the importance of hard work when he said that “genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.“</p>
