                <p class="main-idea" data-uuid="bac0d1801ede4b49a710fe3564c5479a">The Renaissance was a time of rebirth in the arts and in learning.</p>
                <h2 data-uuid="0884c523f1be4797a27647a1f9099c26">Renaissance</h2>
                <div class="yellow-star-yellow-bar" data-uuid="2cf932db5a094c1595d7916b5f11a5f3"></div>

        <p data-uuid="9c1f486ffa724320a00b0a5759771af6">The Renaissance period brought new ways of thinking to Europe, weakening the old feudal system even more. The word <i>Renaissance</i> means “rebirth” and refers to the period that followed the Middle Ages in Europe. This movement began in Italy and eventually spread to other parts of Europe.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="50ab1a17c81447318a75acce95de68db"> During the Renaissance, European rulers began to increase their power over the nobles in their countries. Fewer invasions from outside forces helped bring a period of order and stability to Europe.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="cf1cb30068284ea8b85daccad2b3d839">Search for Knowledge</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c424368cd78a4fba8b9030595c99ac7d">Love of art and education was a key feature of the Renaissance. As Turks conquered much of the Byzantine Empire in the East, scholars fled to Italy. They brought ancient classical writings with them. Some of the works were by Greek thinkers like Plato.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="42755c319dc84fda8abb01068f67d5b1">Excited by the discoveries brought by Turkish scholars, European scholars went looking for ancient texts in Latin. They discovered many Latin texts in monasteries, which had preserved works by Roman writers. As Italian scholars read these ancient texts, they rediscovered the glories of Greece and Rome.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b0844686a4dd4272a9716a64b15e74bf">The search for knowledge and learning spread to all fields, including art, literature, science, and political thought. The Renaissance emphasized the importance of people rather than focusing on religion.</p>
        <p data-uuid="536a9e7ef8064b6fbec8d8f2777723db">This new focus on human value and the study of humanities was called humanism. People’s interest in the humanities led them to respect those who could write, create, or speak well. During the Middle Ages, most people had worked only to glorify God.</p>
        <p data-uuid="443042040c6747ab8c32ab29d6d4e62b">Inspired by early civilizations, artists and writers created works of lasting beauty. Merchants who had become rich from international trade supported their work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2883c6980b24477aa3a56acd2466ad08">Italian artists created some of the most beautiful paintings and sculptures in the world. Their art reflected the basic Renaissance idea—the value of human beings. They rejected flat, two-dimensional images used in medieval art in favor of classical forms and techniques such as perspective. </p>
        <p data-uuid="4c31fc5c163449d297cad1a9cb4ea526"><b><dfn title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</dfn></b> and <b><dfn title="da Vinci, Leonardo">Leonardo da Vinci</dfn></b> are two of the greatest Renaissance artists. They are known for their work in the fields of painting, sculpture, and architecture. Leonardo was also an inventor, engineer, and mapmaker.</p>

        <p data-uuid="baa281867c82480c9af6bef99158f4a3">Italian writers also penned great works of literature. Dante Alighieri was a politician and poet. Before Dante, most authors wrote in Latin, the language of the church. But Dante chose to write in Italian, the common language of the people. This gave ordinary people the opportunity to read Dante’s work.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="e4ebf3cfdd2843be903b9bd09bfd6f04">Many texts that Europeans rediscovered in the 1300s dealt with science. After reading these works, Renaissance scholars went on to make their own scientific advances. They also studied ancient math texts and built on the ideas they read about. For example, they created symbols for the square root and for positive and negative numbers. </p>
        <p data-uuid="e71089ebdaae468bba8724ba9bfe07b6"> Renaissance astronomers discovered that Earth moves around the sun. Other scientists used measurements and made calculations to create better, more accurate maps. Renaissance mapmakers were influenced by the work of Claudius Ptolemy (c.100-178), a Greco-Roman mathematician, astronomer, and geographer who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. His book <i>Geographia</i> was the most popular geographical work printed in movable type in fifteenth century.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d8236c5bc26f46f8805ce89b4a566273">The development of the printing press was a giant step forward in spreading new ideas. In the mid-1400s a German man, <dfn title="Gutenberg, Johannes">Johannes Gutenberg</dfn> (GOOT-uhn-berk), developed a printing press that used movable type. This allowed an entire page to be printed at once. For the first time in history, thousands of people could read the same books and share ideas about them.</p>

        <p data-uuid="2fe10d9c28f845e7a1344c5840c43b25">The growth in trade and services at the beginning of the Renaissance sparked a commercial revolution. This also brought a rise in mercantilism. Mercantilism is an economic system that unifies and increases the power and wealth of a nation.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="3e2df1b68cc84f4baa0cbba81442ffbd"> Four northern Italian cities, Florence, Genoa, Milan, and Venice, developed into important trading centers. These cities played two major roles in trade. They served as ports along the Mediterranean Sea. They also served as manufacturing centers and specialized in certain crafts. This economic activity made some families in these cities very wealthy.</p>

        <p data-uuid="7ddf33cd6378434eb85d2f56ea29cc8a">As trade and commerce grew, the need for banks arose. Bankers in Florence, Italy, kept money for merchants from all over Europe. The bankers also made money by charging interest on funds they loaned to merchants. The greatest bankers in Florence were from the Medici family. Although Florence was already wealthy from trade, banking increased that wealth.</p>
        <p data-uuid="55908d06482c4849aa72e2e23affe440"> During this time, merchants began to create<dfn title="joint-stock company"> joint-stock companies</dfn>, or businesses in which a group of people invest together. In a joint-stock company, the investors share in the company’s profits and losses. Forming joint-stock companies allowed investors to take fewer risks.</p>
