        <p data-uuid="2510b3f503f04905b1a6111977e63b79">When Allied forces liberated Europe, they uncovered evidence of horrifying Nazi crimes against humanity. In a program of mass murder that became known as the <b><dfn title="Holocaust">Holocaust</dfn></b>, Hitler and the Nazis had attempted to exterminate the entire Jewish population of Europe in the name of Aryan supremacy.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="728e0d690e73429f820925a522a0ba26">The Final Solution</h3>
        <p data-uuid="cec06bd85ff845d8bfbb0a96e06d059c">Nazis stripped German Jews of their citizenship and seized their property. On the “night of broken glass,” or <i>Kristallnacht</i>, many Jewish homes and businesses were destroyed. Many Jews who did not escape the country were imprisoned in concentration camps such as Dachau (DAH-kow), near Munich. </p>
        <p data-uuid="91c690ee366f4383b0a19e4a064f6aea"> When Germany conquered huge sections of Europe and the Soviet Union early in World War II, nearly 10 million Jews came under Hitler’s control. The Nazis forced many Jews into urban centers called ghettos. Others were sent to concentration camps and used as slave labor. Many died from hunger or disease. The Nazis also formed special killing squads that rounded up groups of Jews, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, these squads murdered more than 33,000 Soviet Jews near Kiev in three days. By the end of 1941 the death squads had executed nearly 1 million people.<br />

        <p data-uuid="cd6e723afdd34ead92b60b5b9231aec8">In January 1942 senior Nazi officials met to plan what they called “a final solution to the Jewish question.” Hitler’s “final solution” was <b><dfn title="genocide">genocide</dfn></b>, or the extermination of an entire group of people. The Nazi plan was to kill the Jews in specially built death camps, mainly in German-occupied Poland. The camps were equipped with gas chambers designed to kill large numbers of people, and furnaces were used to cremate the bodies of victims. </p>
        <p data-uuid="8bb80cfafb6d464c81927706e542289d"> By mid-1942 the Nazis had begun to ship Jews from throughout German-occupied Europe to the camps. Several hundred thousand Jews, for example, were transported by train from the ghetto in the Polish capital of Warsaw to a death camp called Treblinka. In April 1943 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto staged a violent uprising, attacking the Germans with guns and homemade bombs. It took German troops nearly a month to crush the revolt. Survivors were sent to Treblinka.<br />
