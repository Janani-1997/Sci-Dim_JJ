        <p data-uuid="71c7c04294a34f35889dabd660af563b">Child labor reform was only part of the progressive effort to help American workers. Many Progressives also favored laws to ensure workers’ safety, limit working hours, and protect workers’ rights.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="05ad929453a94815a3cc486ea8bc108c">Workplace Safety</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9972bfe7c00a4738879cac855730927b">Workplace accidents were common in the 1800s and early 1900s. In 1900 some 35,000 people were killed in industrial accidents. About 500,000 suffered injuries. One child described how her sister was injured using a machine in a string factory. “You see you mustn’t talk or look off a minute,” she explained. “My sister was like me. She forgot and talked, and just that minute her finger was off, and she didn’t even cry till she picked it up.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="4bb16caa8fd2440ba002ea656598739f"> Though workplace accidents were not big news in the early 1900s, in 1911 a much greater workplace tragedy shocked the nation. It took place at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a New York City clothing factory that employed mostly Jewish and Italian teenage immigrant women. On the afternoon of March 25, a fire started on the eighth floor of the factory. Workers tried to escape, but factory owners had locked the exit doors—to reduce theft of materials, they said.<br />

        <p data-uuid="e9fbcbdffe78478f8555d783506d1f39">Within moments, the eighth floor was ablaze. The fire spread quickly to two other floors. With the doors locked, escape was nearly impossible. The building’s only fire escape collapsed under the weight of panic-stricken workers, sending them tumbling to their deaths. With flames at their backs, dozens of other workers leaped from the windows. </p>
        <p data-uuid="77036ebb83494cfe964bad9fccd4452a"> By the time firefighters brought the fire under control, 146 workers had died. At a memorial service for the victims, union leader Rose Schneiderman called for action. “It is up to the working people to save themselves,” she said.

Some business owners set up sweatshops in tenement buildings to avoid the labor laws that affected factories.

        <p data-uuid="0062b769ecfe4f8db3928c08e46dafc6">One important case began in New York in 1897, after the state passed a law limiting bakers to a ten-hour workday. Joseph Lochner, a bakery owner, challenged the law. The case eventually went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1905. In <i>Lochner</i>  v. <i>New York</i>, the Supreme Court overturned the New York law that had limited the maximum daily working hours for bakery workers.<span> The Court </span>ruled that states could not restrict the rights of employers and workers to enter into any type of labor agreement. <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York</i> was the first of a quarter century of the Court’s ruling against progressive reforms of working conditions.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ef361514853d468a9143595babdbc510">The Supreme Court did uphold some limits on working hours for women and children.

        <p data-uuid="3f482f9f51e847069340d2d8bc3b63d4">Throughout the Progressive Era, labor unions were a strong force for improving working conditions. During this time, union membership grew, rising from about 800,000 in 1900 to about 5 million in 1920. </p>
        <p data-uuid="a3dd21f307214887bb0c24c6f26b1226">Founded in 1896 and led by Samuel Gompers, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) continued to be one of the strongest labor unions. The AFL focused on better working conditions and pay for skilled workers. Gompers supported the American economic system of <b><dfn title="capitalism">capitalism</dfn></b>, in which private businesses run most industries and competition determines the price of goods. Still, using strikes and other methods, the AFL won wage increases and shorter workweeks.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c5a04bbf89534442b4c45b0be75f6908">Workers also joined energetic new labor unions to fight for reforms. The International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU) was founded in 1900. Unlike the AFL, which allowed only skilled workers, the ILGWU organized unskilled laborers. In 1909 the garment workers called for a mass strike known as the “Uprising of the 20,000.” The strikers won a shorter workweek and higher wages. They also attracted thousands of workers to the union.</p>
        <p data-uuid="518f523dec3440aa9e13020bf0c01d17">Some union members, however, believed in <b><dfn title="socialism">socialism</dfn></b>—a system in which the government owns and operates a country’s means of production. Socialists, led by Eugene V. Debs, hoped that the government would protect workers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d5e49b57394c47f2ae6823820125d4cc"> In 1905 a group of Socialists and union leaders founded a union that welcomed immigrants, women, African Americans, and others not welcome in the AFL. Led by <b><dfn title="Haywood, William “Big Bill”">William “Big Bill” Haywood</dfn></b>, this socialist union was called the <b><dfn title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</dfn></b> (IWW). Its goal was to organize all workers into one large union that would overthrow capitalism. Known as “Wobblies,” IWW members used strikes and boycotts to advance their cause, as well as more radical strategies, such as industrial sabotage.</p>

After a bitter, well-publicized ten-week strike, the mill owners gave in and raised wages. The IWW’s success, however, was short-lived. Several of their strikes were terrible failures. Fearing the union’s revolutionary goals, the government cracked down on the IWW’s activities. Strong opposition led to its decline by 1920.</p>
