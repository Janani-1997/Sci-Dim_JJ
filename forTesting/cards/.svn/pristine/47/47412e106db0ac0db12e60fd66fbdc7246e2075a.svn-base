This majority gave the Republicans the power to override any presidential veto. In addition, the Republicans became united as the moderates joined with the Radicals. Together, they called for a new form of Reconstruction.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4dae81c996ec4d35a71218a9a0b16a56">President Johnson strongly disagreed with Stevens. He argued that African Americans did not deserve the same treatment as white people. The Reconstruction Acts, he said, used “powers not granted to the federal government or any one of its branches.” Knowing that Johnson did not support its Reconstruction policies, Congress passed a law limiting his power. This law, called the Tenure of Office Act, prevented the president from removing cabinet officials without Senate approval. Johnson quickly broke the law by firing Edwin Stanton, the secretary of war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dc3821479a2149c5908269b8d5a788f3">For the first time in United States history, the House of Representatives responded by voting for impeachment of the president. <dfn title="impeachment">Impeachment</dfn> is the process used by a legislative body to bring charges of wrongdoing against a public official. The next step, under Article I of the Constitution, was a trial in the Senate. A two-thirds majority was required to find Johnson guilty and remove him from office.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e0b3002719b84e3c97344307605e99fe"> Although Johnson was unpopular with Republicans, some of them believed he was being judged unfairly. Others did not trust the president pro tempore of the Senate, Benjamin Wade. He would become president if Johnson were removed from office. By a single vote, Senate Republicans failed to convict Johnson. Even so, the trial weakened his power as president.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="c64bc1efcfec4789acfd940bf3f9c36d">Election of 1868</h3>
        <p data-uuid="283965ff01a549cc91ff1d48cc59dd38">Johnson did not run for another term in 1868. The Democrats chose former New York governor Horatio Seymour as their presidential candidate. The Republicans chose Ulysses S. Grant. As a war hero, Grant appealed to many northern voters. He had no political experience but supported the congressional Reconstruction plan. He ran under the slogan “Let Us Have Peace.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="a199325b365542d3866ed7eef9125190">Shortly after Grant was nominated, Congress readmitted seven southern states—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina. (Tennessee had already been readmitted in 1866.) Under the terms of readmission, these seven states approved the Fourteenth Amendment. They also agreed to let African American men vote. However, white southerners used violence to try to keep African Americans away from the polls.</p>
        <p data-uuid="501c7ae6844544f6b0930759fd4dfc60"> Despite such tactics, thousands of African Americans voted for Grant and the “party of Lincoln.” The <i>New Orleans Tribune </i>reported that many former slaves “see clearly enough that the Republican party [is] their political life boat.” African American votes helped Grant to win a narrow victory.</p>
