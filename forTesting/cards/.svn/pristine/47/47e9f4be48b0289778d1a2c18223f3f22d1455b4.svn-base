            ago?” That was the question Republican candidate <b><dfn title="Reagan, Ronald">Ronald Reagan</dfn></b> asked voters during the 1980 presidential
            campaign. Millions of voters answered “No,” giving Reagan an easy victory over
            President Carter. Reagan won 489 electoral votes to Carter’s 49. On January 20,
            1981—the day of Reagan’s inauguration—Iran finally released the American
            hostages after 444 days in captivity.</p>

            Reagan’s approach to government was based on conservative ideas. He
            wanted to cut taxes and reduce regulations on businesses. He promised to scale
            back the size of government, arguing that government involvement in business
            and society harmed individual ambition. “Government is not the solution to our
            problem; government is the problem,” Reagan declared in his inaugural address.<br />

                Reagan grew up in Illinois. In 1937 he moved to California, where he became a
                well-known movie actor. He later entered politics and was elected governor of
                California. Then he served eight years as president.</p>
            <p data-uuid="c82a65d2ee6e45b0a8194fd6c26e88da">Reagan
                worked to reshape the American government and economy based on conservative
                values. In foreign policy, he took an aggressive stand toward communism and the
                Soviet Union. Reagan challenged the Soviet leader to allow freedom in Eastern
                Europe. In a famous speech at the Berlin Wall, he said, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear
                down this wall!” Reagan and Gorbachev later signed the Intermediate-Range
                Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. It was the first treaty that reduced the number of
                nuclear weapons held by both countries.</p>

                Reagan was nicknamed the
                Great Communicator. He inspired many Americans with his sense of humor and his
                optimistic view of America’s future. Many voters credited him with restoring
                their confidence after the difficulties of the 1970s. Many believe that
                Reagan’s buildup of the U.S. military contributed to major changes in the Cold
                War and the eventual fall of Communist governments in the Soviet Union and
                Eastern Europe</p>

        <p data-uuid="a15a71864ecf4cd2b3a4745a43ef29ac">Reagan’s economic policies, which some called
            Reaganomics, were based on a theory called <b><dfn title="supply-side economics">supply-side
            economics</dfn></b>. This theory calls for sharp tax cuts with the goal of
            increasing the amount of money people and businesses have to invest. This
            investment would lead to economic growth and the creation of new jobs. Over
            time, the expanding economic activity would produce increased tax revenues for
            the government.<br />

        <p data-uuid="7390894127a045948194d7ee55a40e73">Though many Democrats opposed this theory,
            Congress approved most of Reagan’s plan for large cuts in business and personal
            taxes. To help balance the budget, Reagan called for spending cuts as well.
            Congress agreed to cut the rate of the growth of spending on social programs
            such as school lunches, low-income housing, and food stamps.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2491084920d8432f985517d2bc3690e7">The economy experienced a brief recession
            early in Reagan’s presidency. Then in 1983 the economy rebounded and began a
            long period of expansion. Business profits and tax revenues increased.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6b0e8dccb64143f6a418002de7f161c6">
            At the same time, spending on defense was increased dramatically, from
            $180 billion in 1981 to nearly $280 billion in 1985. The new spending outpaced
            the new tax revenues. The result was a rapidly rising <b><dfn title="deficit">deficit</dfn></b>—the amount by which a government’s spending exceeds
            its revenues.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="57b6c5e4492b49cfb3b4a024445154fb">Conservative Goals</h3>
        <p data-uuid="64884079097c467fb690c19c6f33c6ed">One of Reagan’s conservative goals was to
            reduce government regulation of key industries. Reagan hoped fewer rules would
            encourage expansion in those industries, thereby improving the U.S. economy.
            Congress responded by reducing regulations on industries such as television,
            airlines, and banking.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3c7e093cd38848718cbe8375f1420330">
            Reagan was also able to move the Supreme Court in a more conservative
            direction by appointing politically conservative judges. In 1981 he appointed
            Sandra Day O’Connor to the Court. She became the first woman to serve as a
            Supreme Court justice. Reagan later appointed two more conservative justices:
            Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.<br />

                she applied for jobs as a lawyer, however, she found that law firms were not
                willing to hire women. She turned instead to public service in Arizona, holding
                jobs including assistant attorney general, state senator, and judge. She was
                serving on the Arizona Court of Appeals when she was nominated to the Supreme
                Court by Ronald Reagan. The Senate confirmed O’Connor’s appointment by a vote
                of 99–0. O’Connor retired from the bench in 2005.</p>
