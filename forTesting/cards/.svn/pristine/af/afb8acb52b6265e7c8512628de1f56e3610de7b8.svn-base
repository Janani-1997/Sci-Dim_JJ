            the twenty-first century. The population is changing and becoming more diverse.&#160;</p>

        <p data-uuid="24ef3a2164064f97ba37a0680e79581a">The U.S. Census Bureau reports that our
            population is more ethnically diverse than ever before. In 2013 the bureau
            reported that Hispanics made up about 17 percent of the country’s total
            population, making them the country’s largest minority group. African Americans
            made up just over 13 percent of the American population. Asian Americans were
            about 5 percent.</p>
        <p data-uuid="86cc9e60072b4696947f37dcd1f4835c">Not only is American society increasingly
            diverse. Individual Americans reflect this diversity as well. In the year 2000 the Census Bureau began allowing people to indicate in official surveys that
            they were of more than one race, and more than 6.8 million Americans did so. In
            2008 American voters chose a man of mixed race, Barack Obama, as president for
            the first time.</p>
        <p data-uuid="67a9f4de57a44724929960411fe0cc1f">
            These
            changes are greatly influenced by immigration patterns. Of the more than 40
            million foreign-born residents, 53 percent were born in Latin America and 28
            percent were born in Asia. Based on these trends, the Census Bureau predicts
            that the country’s non-Hispanic white populations will become a minority by the
            year 2050. The settlement pattern of most immigrants is that they settle in a
            U.S. city heavily populated by people of a similar background.<br />

            referred to as push-pull factors. Push factors are those that cause people to
            leave their homeland and migrate to another place. An example of a push factor
            is an environmental condition, such as drought or other natural disaster, that
            turns habitable land into uninhabitable land. Another example of a push factor
            is a political situation, such as war or the persecution of certain groups of
            people for ethnic or religious reasons. These and other push factors can
            motivate people to immigrate to another country in search of a better
            situation.<br />

            destinations for immigrants attracted to those pull factors. Many immigrants to
            the United States are drawn by economic opportunities. Another example of a
            pull factor is a favorable climate that attracts immigrants to a country.</p>

        <p data-uuid="dacc4f013e984d07b702c5b2a4d59a20">Throughout American history, immigrants have
            added their religious beliefs to the cultural identity of the United States.
            Most of the first settlers in the original English colonies were Protestant
            Christians. Later, immigration increased the numbers of Catholics, Jews, and
            other religions. Today, immigrants continue to add to our nation’s religious
            diversity. As more immigrants come from Asia and Africa, religions from those
            world regions have become a part of the American experience.</p>
        <p data-uuid="729386bbc377444c8ca408410b19b691">
            Currently,
            about 80 percent of Americans identify themselves as Christians. Among
            organized religions, the next largest group is Judaism, at about 2 percent of
            the population. Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism continue to grow in the United
            States, although members of each of these faiths make up less than 1 percent of
            the total U.S.
            population.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="7a8cdff905b445728b58192f27f72812">Older Americans</h3>
        <p data-uuid="2866cdd34493435f98fb6ed658635f9b">The U.S. Census Bureau found in 2010 that Americans
            were older than ever before. The median age was 37.2—six years older than in
            1990. Increased longevity and the aging of the baby-boom generation were the
            reasons behind the rising median age. On average, Americans live to 78.2 years
            of age.<br />

                    American population is living longer and is more ethnically and religiously
                    diverse than ever before. Many of the immigrants today, particularly those from
                    Asia and Africa, are Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, or Sikh, rather than Christian.</p>

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="b157a837a1c0478ca0662b81b2a653f5">This older population places new demands on
            U.S. programs that provide elder care. These programs need to be reworked
            because millions of Americans will soon be affected. This includes health care
            programs such as <b><dfn title="Medicare">Medicare</dfn></b>, which pays medical
            expenses for senior citizens. The costs of providing Medicare are skyrocketing.
            By 2010 the costs exceeded $465 billion. The expense will continue to increase
            as the elderly population increases quickly.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1a16997550374cf7adf99bfc77b23c9d">The older population will also drain another
            U.S. program for the elderly—<b><dfn title="Social Security">Social Security</dfn></b>. It pays benefits to
            retired Americans. The Social Security system was designed to rely on continued
            funding from a vast number of younger workers who would contribute taxes to
            support a small number of retired workers. This worked well when there were
            many more workers than retirees to support. But in the near future, there will
            be so many retired people depending on the system that there will not be enough
            workers to supply the funding needed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d720de657ad04403acf907d92401e238">
            This
            has led to many debates on how to reform the Social Security and Medicare
            systems, but no solutions have been decided upon yet. For Social Security, some
            solutions have been proposed, such as raising deductions for workers, taxing
            the benefits paid to wealthier Americans, and raising the age at which retirees
            can collect benefits. The debates are ongoing.</p>
