            North and South had grown apart in many ways. The regions had different
            economies, different societies, and different goals. People in one region knew
            fairly little about their fellow citizens in another part of the country. As
            both regions pushed westward, their differences led to conflict.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a0e12eb82a1f4662a1f68402731f56bf">
            Many northerners did not want slavery to spread
            to the West. Some opposed it for moral reasons, while others felt it would take
            jobs from white workers. After the Mexican-American War, Representative David
            Wilmot said that slavery should be banned in the new lands gained by the United
            States. Southerners strongly opposed this idea. In the North, the <dfn title="Free-Soil Party">Free-Soil
            Party</dfn> arose to oppose the spread of slavery.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f524222857b94e63afceaef302a8ae04">The
            addition of California as a state threatened to upset the political balance
            between slave and free states in the Union. An unequal balance would affect the
            political makeup of the Senate. The North already had an edge in the House of
            Representatives. Henry Clay offered the <dfn title="Compromise of 1850">Compromise of 1850</dfn> to keep the peace. According to the compromise, California would join the Union as a free state, but other territories in the
            Southwest would be allowed to choose whether to allow slavery.<br />
