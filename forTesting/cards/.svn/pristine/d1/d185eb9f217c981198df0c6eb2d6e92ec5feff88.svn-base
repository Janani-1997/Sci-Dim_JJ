        <p data-uuid="ffc1802bd5eb4e859cd332349dee4813">Massachusetts Bay Colony had to obey English laws. However, the colony’s charter provided more independence than did the royal charter of Virginia. For example, it created a General Court to help run the Massachusetts colony.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ea1ddff62d1a4733bef9db6b3671b074">The Puritan colonists turned this court into a type of self-government to represent the needs of the people. Each town sent two or three delegates to the Court. After John Winthrop served as the colony’s first governor, the General Court elected the governor and his assistants. In 1644 the General Court became a two-house, or bicameral, legislature.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b7e945259eee48a692ca4106a17d8fb1">Politics and religion were closely linked in Puritan New England. Government leaders were also church members, and ministers often had a great deal of power in Puritan communities. Male church members were the only colonists who could vote. Colonists became full members in the church by becoming what the Puritans called God’s “elect,” or chosen. Reaching this status was a difficult process. Individuals had to pass a public test to prove that their faith was strong.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c71243f252d5411190d7bac5e159faee">In 1636 minister Thomas Hooker and his followers left Massachusetts to help found Connecticut, another New England colony. In 1639 Hooker wrote the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. This set of principles made Connecticut’s government more democratic. For example, the Orders allowed men who were not church members to vote. As a result, some historians call Hooker the father of American democracy. The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut also outlined the powers of the General Courts.         </p>

        <p data-uuid="e9e3b1bbec2b48179eba6f15ed62897e">Not all Puritans shared the same religious views. Minister Roger Williams did not agree with the leadership of Massachusetts. He called for his church to separate completely from the other New England congregations. Williams also criticized the General Court for taking land from Native Americans without paying them.</p>
        <p data-uuid="eadcb667b6b34e1da44a3e25c7c59985"> Puritan leaders worried that Williams’s ideas might hurt the unity of the colony. They made him leave Massachusetts. Williams took his supporters to southern New England. They formed a new settlement called Providence. This settlement later developed into the colony of Rhode Island. In Providence, Williams supported the separation of the church from the state. He also believed in religious tolerance for all members of the community.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e487a417feaa41c5a174def283f1e50a">In Boston, an outspoken woman also angered Puritan church leaders. <b><dfn title="Hutchinson, Anne">Anne Hutchinson</dfn></b> publicly discussed religious ideas that some leaders thought were radical. For example, Hutchinson believed that people’s relationship with God did not need guidance from ministers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ed2f606f8a0c4f7d9c3fb3771c31db7b"> Hutchinson’s views alarmed Puritans such as John Winthrop. Puritan leaders did not believe that women should be religious leaders. Puritan leaders put Hutchinson on trial for her ideas. The court decided to force her out of the colony. With a group of followers, Hutchinson helped found the new colony of Portsmouth, later a part of the colony of Rhode Island. </p>

            <p data-uuid="3ba6aab6da1744aaa6345209cfe24cfb">In 1634 Anne Hutchinson emigrated with her family from England to Massachusetts Bay Colony. After settling in Boston, she worked as a nurse and midwife. She also hosted a Bible-study class that met in her home. Over time, Hutchinson began to question the teachings of the local ministers. Meanwhile, her popularity grew.</p>
            <p data-uuid="6be91ade30b24b458eade103542f4485"> After being banished from the colony, Hutchinson settled in Rhode Island and, later, Long Island. She died in a Native American attack. Today, we remember her as a symbol of the struggle for religious freedom.</p>

        <p data-uuid="267133c0a1c44600bdc7ad79f8b5085d">In 1643 the New England colonies made an early move toward unity. Several of the colonies formed the United Colonies of New England. This union was established by the New England Articles of Confederation. The articles were an important document in the development of self-government in the English colonies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b8f745df929549819b9867ff907973a9">Perhaps the worst community conflicts in New England involved the witchcraft trials of the early 1690s. The largest number of trials were held in Salem, Massachusetts. In Salem a group of girls had accused people of casting spells on them. The community formed a special court to judge the witchcraft cases. The court often pressured the suspected witches to confess. Before the trials had ended, the Salem witch trials led to 19 people being put to death.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4070fbb4a9084742a433cdc5cbd7bb49"> The growth of the New England colonies caused conflicts with Native Americans. As colonists spread across New England, they settled where Native Americans already lived and hunted. Each group had different ideas about land ownership. The Wampanoag and other Native American groups believed that no one person could own land. The English, however, believed that if they claimed an area, the land was theirs. The colonists expected the Native Americans to leave the land. Arguments over land sometimes led to wars between the colonists and Native Americans.</p>
