        <p data-uuid="811ae08dd6c0482ea4d1ac7524133512">In the mid-1800s most Americans had thought of the Great Plains and other western lands as the Great American Desert. In the years following the Civil War, Americans witnessed the rapid growth of the U.S. population and the spread of settlements throughout the West. With the admission of the state of California to the Union in 1850, the western boundary of the American frontier had reached the Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b67598ec0ccb4afcb02c293f01abd5d7">The frontier changed dramatically as more and more people moved westward. Settlers built homes, fenced off land, and laid out ranches and farms. Miners, ranchers, and farmers remade the landscape of the West as they adapted to their new surroundings. The geography of the West was further changed by the development and expansion of a large and successful railroad industry that moved the West's natural resources to eastern markets. Gold and silver were the most valuable natural resources, and mining companies used the growing railroad network to bring these precious metals to the East.<br />

        <p data-uuid="902501869c50402b9ad0c81972ed4e90">New methods used by miners to gain access to these precious metals also affected the environment. Hydraulic mining—a technique first used in California in 1853 that gradually spread throughout the west— continues to have an impact to this day. Miners used large hoses to shoot water at hillsides and mountains. The pressure of the water was enough to blast the earth apart like a cannon. Miners then funneled the resulting sediment through sluice boxes that separated the metals from the debris. They used mercury, a toxic chemical, to assist in the process. As a result, a massive volume of sediment, including toxic contaminants, was washed into the region’s rivers, streams, lakes, and bays, causing floods, polluting the local ecosystems, and affecting the wildlife and human populations that depend on them.<br />

                <p data-uuid="fe5b10989a774447afc1068baf1ab0ce">Most of the precious metals were located in western Nevada. In 1859 miner Henry Comstock discovered a huge deposit of gold and silver in Nevada that became called the Comstock Lode. The deposit was incredibly rich and deep. In just the first year after its discovery, the <b><dfn title="Comstock Lode">Comstock Lode</dfn></b> lured thousands of California miners to Nevada. Over the next 20 years, the Comstock Lode produced more than $500 million worth of gold and silver. Expensive equipment was needed to remove the silver and gold that were trapped within quartz rock. Larger mining companies bought up land claims from miners who could not afford this machinery. As a result, mining became a big business in the West.</p>

        <p data-uuid="7c9373ae65664f93b461c4bbb4428cb5">As companies dug bigger and deeper mines, the work became more dangerous. Miners had to use unsafe equipment, such as elevator platforms without protective walls. They worked in dark tunnels and breathed hot, stuffy air. They suffered from lung disease caused by dusty air. Miners often were injured or killed by poorly planned explosions or by cave-ins. Fire was also a great danger. Mining was therefore one of the most dangerous jobs in the country. In the West, worries about safety and pay led miners to form several unions in the 1860s.<br />

Others emigrated from Europe, Central and South America, and Asia. Many Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans were experienced miners. They were skilled in assaying, or testing, the contents of valuable ore. One newspaper reporter wrote, “Here were congregated the most varied elements of humanity . . . belonging to almost every nationality and every status of life.”</p>

They disappeared just as quickly when the mine closed. Most boomtowns had general stores, saloons, and boarding houses. Few women or families lived in boomtowns. “I was never so lonely and homesick in all my life,” wrote one young woman. Women washed, cooked, made clothes, and chopped wood. They also raised families, set up schools, and wrote for newspapers. Their work helped turn some mining camps into successful, permanent towns.</p>

            <p class="intro" data-uuid="2adb9c0acb01474cb71c7380357dfeb8">The California town of Bodie, located just
                southeast of Lake Tahoe, provides a vivid illustration of a mining boomtown. It
                began as a mining camp with just a handful of inhabitants. The discovery of a
                rich vein of gold drew thousands, turning Bodie into a bustling town. Within
                months it had a railroad station, a school, two banks, three newspapers,
                several churches, and dozens of saloons. Once the gold in the mine became
                scarce, however, Bodie went into an equally rapid decline.</p>
