        <p data-uuid="b5b5cd0067bd47e0bb98c9b93aaa32af">By 1870 only small portions of the Great Plains remained unsettled. For most of the next two decades, this land remained open range. In March 1889, government officials announced that homesteaders could file claims on land in what is now the state of Oklahoma. This land had belonged to Creek and Seminole Indians. Within a month, about 50,000 people rushed to Oklahoma to stake their claims.<br />

        <p data-uuid="eef549f341924b48a894c607fddd90dd">In all, settlers claimed more than 11 million acres of former Indian land in the famous Oklahoma land rush. This huge wave of pioneers was the last chapter of the westward movement. From the time it began gathering information, the U.S. Census Bureau had mapped a “frontier line” along the edge of western population. The 1890 census showed that more than 20 million people lived between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Coast. “There can hardly be said to be a frontier line,” a Bureau report stated. The disappearance of the “line” is considered the closing of the frontier.<br />

        <p data-uuid="5b60e219d28a4832a51f271568340715">Three years later, at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, historian Frederick Jackson Turner put forth his “frontier thesis.” His idea stated that the settlement of the West had determined the character of the United States. Turner claimed that the independence, ingenuity, and self-reliance that were needed by frontier settlers defined the values of the American nation.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="943a0b41bdaf4a0f80502c85dd950afb">After the Frontier</h3>
        <p data-uuid="21349492ff70407d92a2b00ad3c7a0c6">As the availability of new land to the west declined, population centers grew. No longer could people strike out for uninhabited territory. Business activities between the East and West became more interconnected, and this strengthened the economy of the whole nation. The national political power of the West grew, although it would be many years before the population became large enough to balance membership in the United States House of Representatives. The end of the frontier was the beginning of the modern United States.</p>
