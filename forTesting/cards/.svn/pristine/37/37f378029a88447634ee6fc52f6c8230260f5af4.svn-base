        <p data-uuid="120c504f63a7444ab3236c374433326c">In the
            1800s powerful Western nations were busy building naval bases to protect their
            shipping routes around the world. This was an aspect of <b><dfn title="imperialism">imperialism</dfn></b>—building an empire by founding colonies or
            conquering other nations. Between 1870 and 1914, Europeans used this foreign
            policy to extend their colonial empires until they controlled most of Africa
            and Southeast Asia.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4db78bca8b7a42c59a156dd077a461e6">Roots
            of Imperialism</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d98b47c958744b5a95a0a04180a448fb">Several forces drove this wave of European
            imperialism. Countries wanted sources of raw materials—such as copper, rubber,
            and tin—to fuel industrial growth. Businesspeople wanted new markets for their
            manufactured goods. And many Europeans saw colonies as a source of power and national
            pride.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8e0c5c35f27a422d8bc3b55dc9869b7e">In contrast, the United States followed a
            limited foreign policy of <b><dfn title="isolationism">isolationism</dfn></b>—avoiding
            involvement in the affairs of other countries. In 1789 President George
            Washington had warned Americans “to steer clear of permanent alliances” with
            other countries. American leaders tried to follow this advice by staying out of
            overseas conflicts.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7d0a1942a03b4187b4066215c0a67914">
            By the late 1800s, however,
            some American leaders believed the United States needed to expand to keep its
            economy strong. They sought new sources for raw materials and new places to
            sell goods. To do so, they wanted the United States to expand beyond North
            America and establish territories overseas. In 1890 Alfred T. Mahan wrote <i>The Influence of Sea Power upon History</i>.
            In this book he argued that the United States needed a strong navy to protect
            its economic interests. Such a navy would need overseas bases and coaling
            stations—places for ships to take on coal for fuel.</p>

            and others argued that it was in the nation’s interest to shift its foreign
            policy. They supported imperial expansionism. This is a policy of gaining power
            by taking control of other lands. For the United States, this meant acquiring
            new lands as U.S. territories. Advocates of expansionism claimed that it would
            increase the nation’s financial prosperity, strengthen the nation’s military,
            and help spread democratic ideals. In the late 1800s the U.S. foreign policy
            did indeed shift from isolationism to imperialism.<br />

            Folly</h3>
        <p data-uuid="207ed9ef4f994bc0baf68cff3e55e49a">The
            United States took its first steps in becoming a world power by acquiring
            Alaska. In 1867 the United States greatly expanded its North American
            territory. Secretary of State <b><dfn title="Seward, William H.">William
            H. Seward</dfn></b> arranged the purchase of Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million.
            Some people thought Alaska was a frozen wasteland, calling the deal “Seward’s
            Folly” [foolish act]. But Seward had purchased an area more than twice the size
            of Texas for two cents an acre. And as he had hoped, Alaska became a source of
            valuable natural resources such as fur, timber, and minerals. Gold was found in
            Alaska in the 1890s, bringing miners and settlers to the area.<br />

            “must continue to move on westward,” the nation also annexed the Midway Islands
            in 1867. The islands’ location about halfway between the U.S. West Coast and
            Japan made Midway an excellent coaling station for the U.S. Navy.</p>

            The United States wanted the
            island group of Samoa for similar reasons. The United States and Germany agreed
            to divide Samoa in 1899.</p>
