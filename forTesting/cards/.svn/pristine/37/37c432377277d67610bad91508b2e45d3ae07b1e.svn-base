        <p data-uuid="9bb3881ee78f4545b84b9de040d2158d">White reformers often overlooked issues such as racial discrimination and segregation. African American reformers found such issues inescapable. They took the lead in addressing these problems.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d304d846a43c48fa9da93c67df125652">One of the most important African American leaders was <b><dfn title="Washington, Booker T.">Booker T. Washington</dfn></b>. Born into slavery, Washington believed that African Americans should not openly challenge segregation. He thought that whites and blacks could work together yet live separate social lives. Over time, Washington believed that African Americans could gain equal social standing by becoming self-sufficient and economically secure. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama to help African Americans learn trades as well as skills for self-sufficiency.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9b1b2a7427014130a28e74746ccad114">Other African Americans spoke out more directly against racial segregation, discrimination, and violence. Journalist <b><dfn title="Wells, Ida B.">Ida B. Wells</dfn></b> wrote articles about the unequal education for African American children. In her Memphis newspaper<i> Free Speech</i>, Wells also drew attention to the lynching of African Americans. During lynchings, people were murdered by mobs instead of receiving a trial. People were lynched after being accused of a crime or even for breaking social codes. More than 3,000 African Americans were lynched between 1885 and 1915. </p>
        <p data-uuid="9301856adfb44accaaef37d25c76eb7e"> After three of her friends were lynched in 1892, Wells started an anti-lynching campaign in her newspaper. Death threats forced Wells to move to the North. But she continued campaigning against lynching. In 1900 she wrote:</p>

        <p data-uuid="eca3a5f1afc84774ad52a39d06969764">Four years later, in 1909, Du Bois helped found an even more influential organization, the <b><dfn title="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</dfn></b> (NAACP). Still active today, the NAACP is a civil rights organization that supports economic and educational equality for African Americans. In its early years, the NAACP worked to secure for African Americans the rights guaranteed by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. These rights included equal protection under the law and voting rights for all adult men.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0c38262c93134bbfb1c3dd6ddcc06d56">The NAACP fought discrimination against African Americans by using the courts. In 1915 it won the important case of <i>Guinn </i>v. <i>United States</i>, which made grandfather clauses illegal. These laws were used in the South to keep African Americans from voting. Grandfather clauses imposed strict qualifications on voters unless their grandfathers had been allowed to vote. Many white voters met this requirement and were automatically permitted to vote in elections. However, most African Americans’ grandfathers had been enslaved and could not vote.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c3d9685486ba4ebfa130a6989b54a8a6"> Another important organization was the National Urban League. It was formed in 1911 by Dr. George Edmund Haynes. This organization aided many African Americans moving from the South by helping them find jobs and housing in northern cities. The Urban League addressed many of the same problems faced by other Progressives, such as health, sanitation, and education.</p>
