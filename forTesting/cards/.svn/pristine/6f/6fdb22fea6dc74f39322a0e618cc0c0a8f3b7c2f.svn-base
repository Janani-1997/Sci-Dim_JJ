        <p data-uuid="969e296de3d440a4b679979a5f446729">As you have read, a main focus for the Allies when the United States entered the war was North Africa. The Germans and British were battling for control there because Axis leaders wanted to grab control of the Suez Canal, a crucial supply route in Egypt. Germany’s Afrika Korps was led by General Erwin Rommel, nicknamed the Desert Fox for his bold, surprise attacks.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d62ba8acf146444087e142b08a99ad46"> In the summer of 1942, Rommel began an offensive to take Egypt. General Bernard Montgomery led the British forces to stop the Germans. The British stopped the Afrika Korps in July at the <b><dfn title="Battle of El Alamein">Battle of El Alamein</dfn></b>. At the same time, U.S. and British troops, led by American general <b><dfn title="Eisenhower, Dwight D.">Dwight D. Eisenhower</dfn></b>, came ashore in Morocco and Algeria, west of Egypt. Caught between two Allied forces, the Afrika Korps surrendered in May 1943.<br />

            <p data-uuid="7c5e7fb1845a4669b0f58ee3f5fabb93">Although a Texan by birth, Dwight D. Eisenhower grew up in Kansas. From an early age, Eisenhower learned the value of hard work and determination. In high school, Eisenhower did well in both classwork and in sports. After high school, he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Upon graduating in 1915 he began a successful military career.</p>
            <p data-uuid="c2df29f93500438b9e5cbc9f09e6a7f4">During World War II, Eisenhower’s brilliant planning helped lead the Allies to victory. In 1942 Eisenhower was put in command of all the American troops fighting in Europe. That same year, he led the Allied invasion of North Africa. The next year, Eisenhower became the commander of all Allied forces. In June 1944, he led the D-Day invasion at Normandy. Six months later, he was made a five-star general—the highest rank in the United States.</p>
            <p data-uuid="6d7a6085d12147e896fec09ded99fd71"> In 1952 Eisenhower decided to retire from the Army and run for president of the United States. His popularity and experience won him the election. He became the nation’s thirty-fourth president. As president he worked to initiate a truce between North and South Korea and to ensure peace in the world.</p>

        <p data-uuid="72df507ff3264277b9edd0b138ed27a9">With North Africa under their control, the Allies prepared to attack the Axis Powers in Europe. Churchill identified Italy as the “soft underbelly” of the Axis. Allied forces invaded the island of Sicily in July 1943 and moved from there to the Italian mainland. Italian leaders overthrew Mussolini and surrendered to the Allies. But Hitler refused to recognize the Axis defeat. He sent German troops to Italy to block the Allied advance.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ec4a947dfd8b46ffbc94cf42d6429c10"> In January 1944, Allied forces tried to get behind the Germans with a surprise attack at Anzio, on the western coast of Italy. American and British troops landed at Anzio but were pinned down on the beach for several months. The “soft underbelly” proved to be much tougher than expected. Finally, the Allied forces in southern Italy battled north to Anzio. The combined forces captured Rome, the capital of Italy, in June 1944. Early in 1945, German forces were driven out of Italy. Italian freedom fighters executed Mussolini. <br />

        <p data-uuid="dca394ea4b534151813e06b32c28dcce">German forces then advanced to the key industrial city of Stalingrad, now called Volgograd. German firebombs set much of the city on fire. But Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was determined to hold on to Stalingrad at all costs. At one point in the fighting, the Soviet forces occupied only a small strip of land along the Volga River. Savage street fighting dragged on for months. The city’s remaining buildings were destroyed. Soviet snipers used the ruined buildings to their advantage, firing at German soldiers from behind piles of stone and brick.<br />

        <p data-uuid="b3dfb302553b44b190aec36e478d907a">German supplies began to run desperately low as the harsh Russian winter began. Hitler remained obsessed with capturing Stalingrad, however. He ordered his troops to keep fighting, though he did not send enough new supplies or soldiers. Thousands of Germans froze or starved to death. In late January 1943 the German commander at Stalingrad defied Hitler and surrendered to save his remaining troops. The <b><dfn title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</dfn></b> thus became a key turning point of the war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5f3766210e074b11913938dc4d87e1cf"> The Soviet victory came at an enormous cost—more than 1 million Soviet soldiers died at Stalingrad. About 800,000 Axis soldiers were killed. After Stalingrad, the Soviets won another victory in the city of Kursk, in the biggest tank battle ever fought. The Axis Powers now began to retreat from the Soviet Union. The tide of the war in the east had turned.<br />
