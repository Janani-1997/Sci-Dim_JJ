        <p data-uuid="864b12c62ccd4bf1972c38318003343f">As the Revolution gathered steam, it became more deadly. At first the Continental army suffered a number of defeats. In time, though, the Patriots’ patience began to pay off.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="3ee1a401def145c29a02981ee219c618">Canada</h3>
        <p data-uuid="ab1a92f0fc3b4cb782121fd08932bfcf">In part because the army was short on supplies, many Patriot leaders favored fighting a defensive war. Others wanted to invade British-controlled Canada and make it the “14th colony.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="d2c9cc98fdb54f9f8cc9b45042147e99">Patriot troops led by General Richard Montgomery captured Montreal in November 1775. The next major target was the city of Quebec. Benedict Arnold, now a general, led his troops north on a remarkable trek through the rough backcountry of Maine. He reached Quebec around the same time that Montreal fell to Montgomery. Since his first attempt to take the city failed, Arnold waited for Montgomery’s troops to join his.</p>
        <p data-uuid="97ea41a1c3da4c6c81d93f008bf9a641"> Taking an immense chance, the combined armies attacked during a fierce blizzard on New Year’s Eve. They were quickly defeated. The Americans had suffered a crushing loss, and the Patriots’ hopes of taking Canada faded.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a9b17c6c3fe34235961ffd18ba9df67a">New York</h3>
        <p data-uuid="32451bb430574d47b76c346a998a6697">New York City became the next battleground. General Washington had moved his troops to New York, expecting the British arrival. Sure enough, in June 1776, a fleet of British ships approached New York Bay. Led by General William Howe, the British forced the Continental army off Long Island.</p>
        <p data-uuid="272008c150174996beee8637f04a831e">Howe’s 32,000 soldiers were much better equipped than Washington’s 23,000 men, most of whom were militia. The Patriot general had to use all of his skills just to save his army.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b93a399561964ea89c287cfb4e83a026"> In a series of battles, Howe pounded the Continental army, forcing it to retreat farther and farther. The Redcoats captured Patriots as well as supplies. Eventually, the British pushed Washington across the Hudson River into New Jersey. Howe’s revenge for his defeat at Boston was complete. When Howe captured New York City, <b><dfn title="Salomon, Haym">Haym Salomon</dfn></b>, a recent immigrant from Poland, stayed there and spied for the Patriots. He later used his skills as a banker to help fund the American Revolution.<br />

Seized by the British with documents hidden in the soles of his shoes, Hale was ordered to be hanged.

Many of these Loyalists fled from other colonies. In the inland part of the New York colony, however, the Patriots still greatly outnumbered the Loyalists.</p>

        <p data-uuid="eb64e522e633451a8d0b8f853c9704ba">In November 1776 the tattered Continental army was on the run. Washington’s remaining 6,000 men were tired and discouraged. The one-year contract for many of them would end on December 31. Who would reenlist in this losing army, and who would replace the soldiers who left? Washington’s army was in danger of vanishing.</p>
        <p data-uuid="734c833a721040b5888a0ff713894642">Thinking the rebellion would end soon, Howe left New Jersey in the hands of soldiers from the German state of Hesse.

        <p data-uuid="415cfe9ad8684e7ab534317f82f7b31d"> On December 7 Washington retreated across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. Even with 2,000 fresh troops, the Patriots were near the end.<br />

The strategy required perfect timing. According to the plan, Burgoyne’s army would invade from Canada, recapture Fort Ticonderoga, and sweep south to Albany. General Howe, in New York City, would sail up the Hudson River to meet him, strangling New England.</p>
        <p data-uuid="783265cfe50440878175b0df8fb55734">Indeed, Burgoyne took Ticonderoga in early July and headed toward Albany. Here, the timing went wrong for the British. Unknown to Burgoyne, Howe had left New York, sailed up the Chesapeake Bay, and captured Philadelphia. Delegates to the Continental Congress were forced to flee.</p>
        <p data-uuid="45ea32f4cafd4d47951d4ecb155ac19b"> Meanwhile, Burgoyne’s army was bogged down in thick forests. The Patriots had chopped down large trees and dammed rivers to create obstacles. All along the route, the militia swarmed out of nowhere to attack the Redcoats. As Burgoyne neared Saratoga, New York, he found himself surrounded. On October 17, 1777, he was forced to surrender his entire army to General Horatio Gates.<br />
