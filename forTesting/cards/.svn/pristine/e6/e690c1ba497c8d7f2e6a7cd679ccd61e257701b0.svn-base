        <p data-uuid="dc411968080c48b281134f90c26e756d">Millions of Americans at this time were immigrants or children of immigrants. Many came from countries belonging to the Allied or Central powers. They naturally sympathized with their former homelands. This did not change the fact that most Americans viewed World War I as a European conflict. They did not want American soldiers sent to the bloody battlefields of Europe. Shortly after World War I began, President Woodrow Wilson announced that the United States would remain neutral. Most Americans agreed that the United States should stay out of the war. However, eventually international, economic, and military developments swayed opinion in the United States. The country entered World War I on the side of the Allied powers.<br />

        <p data-uuid="211c119372514b8b9d89642c64acf7df">Although the United States had a policy of neutrality, its merchants continued to trade with European nations. American ships carried supplies and war materials to the Allies. U.S. banks invested $2 billion in European war bonds, nearly all of it in Allied countries.</p>
        <p data-uuid="add1e3730ee14df9bcae57c995992209"> The Germans used U-boat attacks to try to stop supplies from reaching the Allies. Sometimes they attacked ships without warning. In May 1915 a German U-boat sank the <dfn title="Lusitania"><i>Lusitania</i></dfn>, a British passenger liner.<br />

Wilson demanded that the Germans stop attacking nonmilitary ships. German leaders responded with the Sussex pledge, agreeing not to attack merchant ships without warning.<br />

Nearly a year after the Sussex pledge, however, the Germans again began launching attacks on ships, including American vessels. In response, Wilson broke off diplomatic relations with Germany.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6697a83931494f8eb1cc971d49e7c930"> The United States stepped closer to war when Americans found out about the <b><dfn title="Zimmermann note">Zimmermann note</dfn></b>, sometimes called the Zimmermann telegram. This secret telegram to Mexico sent by the German foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, was decoded and then published by American newspapers in March 1917. In the note, Zimmermann proposed an alliance against the United States. He promised that Germany would help Mexico recapture areas that Mexico had lost during the Mexican-American War.<br />
