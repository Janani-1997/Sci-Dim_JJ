        <p data-uuid="34b4fca92f3f41ffa412a6fe14f5087f">The
            United States is a very different place today than it was in 1877. The nation
            is now bigger, more powerful, and more involved in world affairs. It has
            changed from a nation where most people lived in small towns to one in which
            most people live in cities, many with populations of more than 1 million
            people. The nation is also a more democratic place today—more Americans have
            access to the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship than at any other
            time in the country’s history.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="c2ef12b813cf41249c1377773ae6a9df">Still,
            the United States grapples with many challenges that are similar to those faced
            by the nation in 1877. For example, Americans still debate questions about
            civil rights, religion, taxes, and the role of government in their lives.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="7ae5dee429b84405a0210fa8cce83c14">They
            also worry about the health of the environment, children, and the poor.
            Americans do not always agree on these issues. But they do believe strongly in
            their right to debate and to disagree. The freedom to do so—in peaceful and
            productive ways—is an indication of the fundamental health of the nation.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="c7db6595913e48979c07f062df0391cb">The United States as a Global Power</h3>
        <p data-uuid="dd90b6e82f374bcdbf50f708a598cb10">After
            the Civil War, the U.S. government and westward-bound settlers increasingly came into conflict with Native
            Americans. The last major battle between U.S. soldiers and Native Americans occurred at Wounded Knee in 1890, and after that battle, settlers began moving west in even greater numbers. In 1898 the Spanish-American War began. The United States and Spain battled each other in the Caribbean and
            the Philippines. The Spanish-American War marked the beginning of a period of American
            expansionism during which U.S. influence spread throughout Latin America and
            the rest of the world.</p>

        <p data-uuid="befdfde719604fd691a091d62b448415">In
            1914 World War I began in Europe. By 1917 the United States had entered the
            war, and American soldiers fought and died on the battlefields of Europe. That
            experience forever changed the United States. America had stepped onto the
            world stage with its military and industrial might. War tore Europe apart again
            in the 1930s and 1940s during World War II. When Japan attacked the United
            States at Pearl Harbor in late 1941, the United States entered the global
            struggle. The United States joined forces with the Allies, a military alliance that included France, Poland, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p data-uuid="16e2146a619c455894a19300f58316dd">The Allied victory in World War II had many consequences that affected the lives of Americans. For example, millions of World
            War II veterans returned home ready to start new lives in peacetime. These
            veterans enrolled in college in record numbers, settled into the nation’s
            cities and new suburbs, and started families.&#160;</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="ba5b447cff594299a92529cdb47659f3">The Civil Rights Era</h3>
        <p data-uuid="6147b0f87d4e464694e808e0e37ae1dd">Many of the American soldiers
            who had fought on the side of the Allies abroad also fought for democratic changes at
            home. This was especially true of the nation’s African American and
            Mexican American soldiers. Their efforts to seek greater access to the rights
            of citizenship helped invigorate the civil rights movement. They were joined in
            these efforts by Americans from all walks of life—people who believed that
            America worked best when the promises of freedom were open to all.&#160;</p>

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="75692468d37642ff809d5c0474274653">By
            the 1960s the push for greater civil rights had become a true social movement
            in the United States. It was a grassroots effort, where ordinary
            Americans worked to change both people’s attitudes and federal laws. C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, for
            example, led the fight to win more rights for migrant workers. This movement
            for greater civil, educational, and political rights for all racial and ethnic
            groups helped spur the women’s rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s.&#160;</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="2777b56dc9c24298ad4afe2e16ed7158">Economic Changes and Challenges</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c96dd8a0df484a268a80be79c034fa04">The
            U.S. economy has also changed dramatically since 1877. Changes in technology
            led to a second industrial revolution in which manufacturing processes became
            more focused on machinery than on workers. In the 1930s, millions of Americans
            were affected by the huge economic collapse known as the Great Depression.&#160;</p>

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="1d6576446bce473cbfc66fc5cad2f0dd">After World War II, the U.S. economy recovered, and the nation enjoyed a long
            period of prosperity. Many Americans joined the middle class for the first
            time, buying homes, televisions and appliances, and cars in record numbers.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="b1db3e36d0eb43abac7634bedbfedb9f">Since
            the 1970s, the U.S. economy has had more ups and downs. Many American companies
            have moved their factories overseas where wages are lower, causing hardship for
            many American workers. Technology and housing booms during the 1990s and early
            2000s created prosperity. In the late 2000s, however, a severe economic crisis
            emerged. The banking system nearly collapsed, houses and stocks plummeted in
            value, and millions of people lost their jobs. Many economists think it may
            take a decade or more for the U.S. economy to fully recover.&#160;</p>

        <p data-uuid="32cd5feeb8db41518515dc626e6fa040">Immigration
            has always been important to the United States. Since 1877, immigrants have continued to make significant contributions to American life. During the 1900s, immigrants came to
            the United States from all corners of the world—Latin America, Africa, Asia,
            and Europe. In addition to representing various cultures, they also represented
            different religious traditions, including Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and
            Sikhism. As did the immigrants that came before them, they came in search of a
            brighter future, greater freedom, and a chance to start their lives over
            again—and they came to become Americans.</p>

                    the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, relations between the United States and
                    Vietnam have slowly improved. In 1995 the U.S. and Vietnam officially
                    established diplomatic relations. Today, about 1.7 million Americans trace
                    their ancestry to Vietnam.</p>

            also come to the United States to enjoy the benefits of democracy. The United
            States was the world’s first modern democracy, and many people around the world
            today look to America as an example of a democratic, free, and open society.
            Since 1877, American democracy has expanded. More people are able to
            participate in the democratic process than ever before, and there is a healthy
            debate over the many issues the country faces now and will face in the coming
            years.</p>

            the years since 1877, the United States has faced challenges and experienced
            triumphs. The threat of terrorism—made clear by the terrorist attacks of
            September 11, 2001—remains an ongoing challenge. And for many Americans,
            especially those who toiled to achieve the gains of the civil rights movement,
            a triumph came with the election of Barack Obama, our nation’s first
            African American president, in 2008.</p>

            and triumphs alike highlight the importance of our nation’s founding
            principles. More than 200 years ago, the Founders insisted that the
            United States was an experiment—a new nation devoted to the possibility that
            the ideals of equality and freedom could be supported by democracy, justice,
            and the rule of law. This experiment works best when
            Americans together exercise their rights responsibly.&#160;</p>
