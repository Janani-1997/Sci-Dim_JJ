        <p data-uuid="290251a622154b5b90d5bf7d7133f65b">The push for black civil rights in the United States gained new momentum after World War II. As black veterans came home, many of them were no longer willing to put up with discrimination. They and other African Americans began to call for an end to racial inequality and campaigned for change. As a result, African Americans made a number of key gains. In 1948 President Harry S. Truman desegregated the armed forces. That same year, Truman also banned discrimination in the hiring of federal employees. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, elected in 1952, took further steps to reduce racial discrimination in hiring practices. Meanwhile, at the state level, several northern and western states passed laws banning racial discrimination in public housing.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6631e34fb0934b29acc16515f3bfaa11">Despite these gains, many opportunities remained closed to African Americans in the 1950s. Although this period was a time of economic prosperity for many white Americans, few black Americans shared in this new wealth. Furthermore, white resistance to black equality remained strong. Such opposition was particularly evident in the South. White citizens continued to use unfair laws, fear, and violence to keep black citizens from voting or standing up for their rights.<br />

                <p data-uuid="f5a616ec23644155a42b07935f69dd6a" class="caption">Since the late 1800s, the courts deemed segregation to be legal as long
                    as the facilities were equal. However, more often than not, the separate
                    facilities, such as these water fountains, were very far from being equal.</p>

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="e6f38cc7c17c467db2b6c249720b0724">One major barrier to equality for blacks was segregation. The 1896 Supreme Court case <i>Plessy </i>v. <i>Ferguson </i>established the “separate-but-equal” doctrine. This doctrine stated that federal, state, and local governments could allow segregation as long as separate facilities were equal. One result of this ruling was that states in both the North and South maintained separate schools for white and black students. Government officials often insisted that though these schools were separate, they were equal in quality.</p>
        <p data-uuid="376bb089f9494a6598daa3a66b6fbfaf"> In fact, however, schools for black children typically received far less funding. Early civil rights leaders focused on ending segregation in America’s public schools. Leaders of the movement were members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).<br />

        <p data-uuid="3d689b0235ce4500bd7a6e248c012098">The NAACP’s strategy was to show that separate schools were unequal. The NAACP attorneys <dfn title="Marshall, Thurgood">Thurgood Marshall</dfn>, who went on to become a Supreme Court justice, and Jack Greenberg led the courtroom battles against segregation. In the early 1950s, five school segregation cases from Delaware, Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, DC, came together under the title of <dfn title="Brown v. Board of Education"><i>Brown </i>v. <i>Board of Education</i></dfn><i></i>. The “Brown” in the case title was a seven-year-old African American girl from Topeka, Kansas, named Linda Brown. Though she lived near a school for white children, Linda Brown had to travel across town to a school for black children. Linda’s father and the NAACP sued to allow Linda to attend the school closer to her home.<br />

In May 1958 Ernest Green became the first African American student to graduate from Central High.

        <p data-uuid="6f21148e25614d74bba9f430c91502ec">Despite early victories against segregation, blacks remained second-class citizens to many white Americans, particularly in the South. This situation gained nationwide attention in 1955 with the murder of <dfn title="4e50cb8551d84fefa9023bccfaece99c">Emmett Till</dfn>, a 14-year-old boy from Chicago, Illinois. Till had gone to the town of Money, Mississippi, to visit relatives. Having grown up in the North, the black teenager did not understand the South’s strict racial etiquette. Shortly after arriving in Money, Till visited a local grocery store where he said something to the owner, a young white woman named Carolyn Bryant. She later claimed he asked her for a date and whistled at her, but there is some doubt that this was the case. Whatever Till said, she took offense. Her husband, Roy, soon found out about the incident.<br />
