        <p data-uuid="3d3e923730504d9bb824754630357deb">Tensions between France and Great Britain began to build after the French people rebelled against their king. On July 14, 1789, citizens of Paris attacked and captured the Bastille, a hated fortress and prison that stood as a mighty symbol of royal power.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6d16c588dea1442eb43a52ef03bf357a">The storming of the Bastille was one of the first acts of the <b><dfn title="French Revolution">French Revolution</dfn></b>—a rebellion of French people against their king in 1789. The French people overthrew their king and created a republican government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="62c383300990476593d72f08b605f465">Many French citizens had been inspired to take action by the American Revolution. Many Americans, in turn, supported the French Revolution. They thought that France was creating the same kind of democracy as the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f1e13962032041f2ae13078f2998692d">Some Americans worried about the French Revolution’s violent riots and attacks on traditional authority. Revolutionaries shocked many Americans by beheading King Louis XVI in January 1793 and Queen Marie-Antoinette later that year.</p>

Washington believed his plan was the safest for the long run, but not everyone agreed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4e0bbadc6e284b2baf9a0fbcc49eeece">Some members of Congress criticized Washington’s ideas. James Madison believed that the president had gone beyond his authority. He questioned Washington’s right to issue the proclamation without the approval of Congress.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="c6e57bedba464b7692ae03ea10f585a4">The French Question</h3>
        <p data-uuid="4ada2a61970f46af9b490207f7004877">France’s new representative to the United States, Edmond Genet (zhuh-NAY), asked American sailors to help France fight England by commanding <b><dfn title="privateer">privateers</dfn></b>. Privateers were private ships hired by a country to attack its enemies. Washington told Genet that using American privateers violated U.S. neutrality. Jefferson wanted the French revolutionaries to succeed, but even he agreed that allowing France to use American privateers against England was a bad idea.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c996bfa733c444d49401a7691750239e">Jefferson was still upset by U.S. policy toward France. He believed that the United States should back France because France had supported the United States during the Revolutionary War. Hamilton, on the other hand, was pro-British. He hoped to strengthen trading ties with Britain—the most powerful trading nation in the world at the time. Jefferson thought that Hamilton had too much influence on the president’s foreign policy and that Hamilton interfered with Jefferson’s role as secretary of state. Jefferson decided to resign from Washington’s cabinet in 1793.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="684d2146c4f74bd38929bc58d683f080">Jay’s Treaty</h3>
        <p data-uuid="938740f66def478daeff8271dc6b124c">There were other threats to U.S. neutrality. In late 1793 the British seized ships carrying food to the French West Indies. Hundreds of the ships were neutral American merchant ships. Also, British officers were helping Native Americans fight settlers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3db35248c2404dc98de001d1ab11e61a">Washington wanted to prevent another war with the British. He sent Chief Justice John Jay to London to work out a compromise. The British knew the United States lacked a strong navy and that U.S. businesses relied heavily on British trade. However, the British did not want to fight another war in America.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7e8de3d15fe946588949daeca0950870">In November 1794 the two sides signed <b><dfn title="Jay’s Treaty">Jay’s Treaty</dfn></b>. Jay’s Treaty settled the disputes that had arisen between the United States and Great Britain in the early 1790s. The British would pay damages on seized American ships and abandon their forts on the northwestern frontier. The United States agreed to pay debts it owed the British.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e416e6ddbbed46a5ac197781e513a1a8">The treaty was unpopular and sparked violent protests. Citizens and congressional leaders thought the treaty hurt trade and did not punish Britain enough for some of its actions. Southerners were especially angry that the treaty did not ask Britain to repay them for slaves that Britain had set free during the Revolutionary War. Washington did not like the treaty but believed it was the most that could be done. At his urging, the Senate approved the treaty.</p>

        <p data-uuid="84eaeee06db04893b24db044f309da4f">American businesses faced problems as well. The Spanish disputed the border between the United States and Florida. Spain closed the port of New Orleans to U.S. trade in 1784. This hurt the American economy because all goods moving down the Mississippi to places in the East or overseas had to pass through New Orleans.</p>

        <p data-uuid="510a63d3cda445c09aed20a21dccdee2">Washington asked Ambassador Thomas Pinckney to meet with Spanish officials to discuss the problem. He asked the Spaniards to reopen New Orleans to U.S. trade. Pinckney also asked for the right of deposit in New Orleans. This right would allow American boats to transfer goods in New Orleans without paying cargo fees.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f83c4acdfca74944a9239050cd7897fc">Spanish minister Manuel de Godoy (goh-THOY) tried to delay reaching an agreement, hoping Pinckney would become desperate and sign a treaty that favored the Spanish. He was worried that the United States and Great Britain might join against Spain after signing Jay’s Treaty. Pinckney was patient, however, and his patience was rewarded. In October 1795 Godoy agreed to <b><dfn title="Pinckney’s Treaty">Pinckney’s Treaty</dfn></b>, which settled the border and trade disputes with Spain. </p>
