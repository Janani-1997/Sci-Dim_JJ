        <p data-uuid="a6b10dbae1df487bb3caec159508425f">In the presidential election of
            1800, Federalists <b><dfn title="Adams, John">John Adams</dfn></b> and Charles C. Pinckney ran against
            Democratic-Republicans Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. Each party believed
            that the American republic’s survival depended upon the success of their candidates.
            With so much at stake, the election was hotly contested.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d61aab101e19493d87c053c38acd8738">Unlike
            today, candidates did not travel around giving speeches. Instead, the
            candidates’ supporters made their arguments in letters and newspaper
            editorials. Adams’s supporters claimed that Jefferson was a pro-French radical.
            Put Jefferson in office, they warned, and the violence and chaos of the French
            Revolution would surely follow in the United States. In addition, Federalists
            argued that Jefferson’s interest in science and philosophy proved that he
            wanted to destroy organized religion.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d5b0208d7edf4238b01f5e425c37ccb2">Democratic-Republican
            newspapers responded that Adams wanted to crown himself king. What else, they
            asked, could be the purpose of the Alien and Sedition Acts? Republicans also
            hinted that Adams would use the newly created permanent army to limit Americans’
            rights.</p>

        <p data-uuid="730b5c31b96541fcab0690e01d1b6ff1">When
            the election results came in, Jefferson and Burr had won 73 electoral votes
            each to 65 for Adams and 64 for Pinckney. The Democratic-Republicans had won
            the election, but the tie between Jefferson and Burr caused a problem. Under
            the Constitution at that time, the two candidates with the most votes became
            president and vice president. The decision went to the House of
            Representatives, as called for in the Constitution.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9c3095c616fa42a9a8e9ce680530de99">The House,
            like the electoral college, also deadlocked. Days went by as vote after vote
            was called, each ending in ties. Exhausted lawmakers put their heads on their
            desks and slept between votes. Some napped on the House floor.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ea93a2dd884046ad8bc2856a47297c77">Jefferson
            finally won on the thirty-sixth vote. The election marked the first time that
            one party had replaced another in power in the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3f71651b96ba4d4dbec5e529fce6048f">
            The
            problems with the voting system led Congress to propose the Twelfth Amendment.
            This amendment created a separate ballot for president and vice president. &#160;</p>
