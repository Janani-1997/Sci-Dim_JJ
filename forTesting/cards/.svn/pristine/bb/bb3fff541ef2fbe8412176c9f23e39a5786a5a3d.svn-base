            and freedoms of all people. He reduced U.S. aid to several former allies that
            committed human rights violations. In South Africa, Carter hoped to pressure
            the government into ending apartheid,
            a system of laws requiring racial segregation. He called for <b><dfn title="sanctions">sanctions</dfn></b>, or economic

            effects in Latin America as well. Many Latin Americans resented previous U.S.
            interference in their countries. American control of the Panama Canal stood as
            a symbol of power in the region. In 1977 Carter signed treaties that would
            transfer control of the canal to Panama by the year 2000.</p>

            Carter had less success improving relations with the Soviet Union.
            D&#233;tente broke down when he criticized the Soviet Union for committing human
            rights abuses. Then in 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Carter
            responded by breaking off arms-control talks and refusing to allow U.S.
            athletes to participate in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.<br />

            to ease tensions in the Middle East. Egypt and Israel had been in conflict for
            30 years. In 1978 Carter invited Egyptian president Anwar el-Sadat and Israeli

            retreat at Camp David, Maryland. After 13 days of meetings, the two leaders

            Middle East. The United States had supported the pro-American shah, or king, of
            Iran since the 1950s. Many Iranians resented the shah’s reform efforts. They
            also disliked the country’s shift from a traditional and agricultural society
            to a more urban and industrial one. The government severely punished its
            opponents and controlled all political participation. Many members of the
            opposition supported the views of Islamic spiritual leader Ruhollah Khomeini.
            Khomeini had been forced to leave the country because of his criticisms of the
            shah’s policies.<br />

            In 1979 Khomeini’s supporters drove the shah out of Iran. A month later,
            Khomeini took control of the government. On November 4, a group of Iranian
            students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran, the capital of Iran, seizing
            about 90 American hostages. The <b><dfn title="Iran hostage crisis">Iran

            banks. After a failed rescue attempt in April 1980, many Americans lost
