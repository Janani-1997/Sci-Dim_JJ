        <p data-uuid="3607984bcc094c37945eb2c76a6bd743">In the late 1800s many
            entrepreneurs formed their businesses as <b><dfn title="corporation">corporations</dfn></b>,
            or businesses that sell portions of ownership called stock shares. The leaders
            of these corporations were some of the richest and most influential members of
            American society in the late 1800s. Political leaders praised prosperous
            businesspeople as examples of American hard work, talent, and success.&#160;<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="5d18357270c742ff9473a121f04ec2f2">Corporations Generate Wealth</h3>
        <p data-uuid="04093dfc597944eb957a41bba840085b">Successful
            corporations reward not only the people who found them but also investors who
            hold stock. Stockholders in a corporation typically get a percentage of profits
            based on the amount of stock they own. Although stockholders actually own the
            corporation, they do not run its day-to-day business. Instead, they elect a board
            of directors that chooses the corporation’s main leaders, such as the
            president.</p>
        <p data-uuid="03e5aadd086d406da1d9ffabe40ef63d">
            Corporations provided several important advantages
            over earlier business forms. Stockholders in a corporation are not responsible
            for business debts. If a corporation fails financially, the stockholders lose
            only the money that they invested. Stockholders are also usually free to sell
            their stock to whomever they want, whenever they want. As a result,
            corporations encouraged more investment in businesses. By 1900 more than 100 million
            shares per year were being traded on the New York Stock Exchange.&#160;<br />

        <p data-uuid="9804ea5caad14c5989d92d7668e48bf7">Some business
            leaders became wealthy, powerful, and famous because of the business boom. <b><dfn title="Carnegie, Andrew">Andrew
            Carnegie</dfn></b> was one of the most admired businesspeople of the time. Born in
            Scotland, Carnegie came to the United States as a poor immigrant. As a teenager, he took a job with a railroad company and quickly worked his way up to the
            position of railroad superintendent.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ecac3f7205384d4a9949ff0ffdd7da5f">
            In 1873 he focused his
            efforts on steelmaking. Carnegie expanded his business by buying out
            competitors when steel prices were low. By 1901 Carnegie’s mills were producing
            more steel than all of Great Britain’s mills combined. Carnegie’s businesses
            succeeded largely through <b><dfn title="vertical integration">vertical integration</dfn></b>, or ownership of
            businesses involved in each step of a manufacturing process. For example, to
            lower production costs, Carnegie acquired the iron ore mines, coalfields, and
            railroads needed to supply and support his steel mills.<br />

            also successful in consolidating, or combining, businesses. By age 21, while a
            partner in a wholesale business, he decided to start an oil-refining company.
            In only ten years, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company was the country’s largest
            oil refiner. Like Carnegie, Rockefeller used vertical integration. For example,
            the company controlled most of the pipelines it used.</p>
        <p data-uuid="981db18ec1114187ba3dcef83ad8ab22">Rockefeller’s

            United States. Rockefeller also formed a <b><dfn title="trust">trust</dfn></b>,
            a legal arrangement grouping together a number of companies under a single
