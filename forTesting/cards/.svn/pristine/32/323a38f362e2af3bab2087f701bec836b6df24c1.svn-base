            each state to send delegates to a convention with the goal of improving the
            Articles of Confederation. The convention opened on May 25, 1787, in
            Philadelphia. The first order of business was to nominate a president for the
            convention. Every delegate voted for the hero of the Revolution, George
            Washington.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3a49d292fc7542ef9f53941bf8ab5a16">The
            55 delegates to the <b><dfn title="Constitutional Convention">Constitutional Convention</dfn></b>, as the Philadelphia
            meeting became known, were a very impressive group. Many had been members of
            their state legislatures and had helped write their state constitutions. Roger
            Sherman, a Connecticut delegate, was a signer of the Declaration of
            Independence and the Articles of Confederation. Pennsylvania’s Gouverneur
            Morris had also signed the Articles of Confederation. Pennsylvania
            delegate James Wilson was known for his brilliant legal mind. Virginia delegate
            <b><dfn title="Madison, James">James Madison</dfn></b>&#160;contributed many ideas
            that shaped the Constitution.</p>

            number of key people were unable to attend. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams
            were overseas at their diplomatic posts. Others had political objections. For
            example, Patrick Henry, who had been elected as a delegate from Virginia,
            refused to go. He said he “smelled a rat . . . tending toward monarchy.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="648a3473d48a4b96a60fea73aef364ba">Also,
            the convention did not reflect the diverse U.S. population of the 1780s. There
            were no Native Americans, African Americans, or women among the delegates.
            These groups of people were not recognized as citizens and were not invited to
            attend.</p>
