Obama worked as a lawyer and community organizer in Chicago before entering politics. He won his first race for the Illinois State Senate in 1996 and was reelected in 1998. He lost a 2000 bid for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004. Obama came to national attention with his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He became the Democratic Party nominee for president four years later. In 2009 Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, the fourth American president to win this honor.</p>

        <p data-uuid="881c8f9aea7b4b61b7a8cd6b6a957909">Soon after taking office, Obama pushed through an economic stimulus package in an effort to end the recession brought on by the crash of the financial markets in 2008. The $787 billion stimulus package law was intended to create 3.5 million American jobs within two years. By the end of 2009, the Federal Reserve reported that there were some signs that a slow economic recovery had begun.</p>

        <p data-uuid="67152f84c2984baa9d39c4cda0553b73">President Obama also tackled health care reform. A major issue facing the country was that many Americans did not have health insurance and were suffering for it. Some 17.4 percent of non-elderly Americans were uninsured in 2008. About 8 million of those were children.<br />

His proposals were controversial, especially among Republicans. On September 9, Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to firm up support for the plan.</p>

The plan I’m announcing tonight would meet three basic goals. It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance for those who don’t. And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families, our businesses, and our government. It’s a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge—not just government, not just insurance companies, but everybody including employers and individuals. And it’s a plan that incorporates ideas from senators and congressmen, from Democrats and Republicans—and yes, from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="73947291b34c44bbbbb616a48e3579a3">In 2010 President Obama signed the <b><dfn title="Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</dfn></b> (PPACA) into law. The law aimed to make health care affordable to all Americans. It also specified that most Americans were required to get some level of health insurance. Beginning in 2013 uninsured Americans could buy health insurance plans set up in accordance with the PPACA. However, many people criticized aspects of Obama’s health care reform. For instance, whether or not the government could mandate that citizens obtain health insurance is hotly debated.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f7e36603885149f0b44cf629ab3dce8b"> Issues with health care reform combined with continuing high unemployment rates made some voters unhappy. Many Americans did not see any economic improvement in their lives. This discontent led to Republicans gaining a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="7dabdea7ac8d486ba18964b305046b23">War and Terrorism</h3>
        <p data-uuid="73a54d0ea24049ba9901425ca8c915c7">The Obama administration made specific plans to end combat operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010 Operation Iraqi Freedom ended seven years after it began, with a withdrawal of combat troops. About 50,000 troops remained for smaller missions and to train Iraqi soldiers until the end of 2011. However, military operations in Afghanistan increased. Obama announced in 2009 that an additional 30,000 troops would be sent to Afghanistan to keep the Taliban from gaining ground. These soldiers joined about 70,000 already there.</p>

        <p data-uuid="7c492cb3ea7d40919f239f9a4cace52b">Efforts to combat terrorism continued. In 2011 U.S. Special Forces tracked down and killed terrorist Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. This was a huge blow against al Qaeda. A terrorist group known as the Islamic State, or ISIS, gained strength and became a threat in 2014. ISIS quickly captured large areas of territory in Iraq and Syria. The Obama administration responded with military airstrikes against ISIS with the help of other allied countries. The United States also sent several thousand troops to Iraq to help train Iraqi forces.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="22c1f5da3121435a83155f69bd913ca2">Gun Violence</h3>
        <p data-uuid="dda2f0ded3fc43ce823be97f5cb7f89f">Domestically, gun violence in schools and elsewhere was a growing problem that challenged presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama. School shootings and other mass shootings happened in the United States about 67 times between 1996 and 2014. It became a top priority to Americans to stop gun violence everywhere. But how to solve the problem has been debated over and over again with differing opinions.</p>
        <p data-uuid="77c5299c3d074a4bbf3d72d2d1be6fee"> In 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms applies to local and state gun control laws. The Court held that the right to self-defense is fundamental to American civil liberties. This meant that laws banning handguns at state and local levels were unconstitutional. In 2013 President Obama responded to the killing of 20 first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut, with proposals to tighten federal gun-control laws. His plan included background checks for gun sales, an assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazine capacity, and other measures. The gun control debate is ongoing. </p>
