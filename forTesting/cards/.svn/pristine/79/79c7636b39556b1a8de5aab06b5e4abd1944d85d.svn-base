        <p data-uuid="71a1c3a4c2004b3c8ed7d15d9cd1c2ab">The experience of living through World War I changed the way many young people saw the world around them and inspired social changes. Young men returning from Europe had visited far-off countries and learned about other cultures. Many of them came home with a desire to continue expanding their horizons. The title of one popular song in 1919 asked, “How ‘Ya Gonna Keep’ em Down on the Farm after They’ve Seen Paree [Paris]?”</p>
        <p data-uuid="e21c1ee9f09546f494910d6e36b0be18">Many young people moved away from farms and small towns to cities. By 1920, for the first time in American history, more than half of the country’s population lived in urban areas. Young people took advantage of the economic opportunities of the 1920s to gain independence. In the past, most young people had lived and worked at home until they got married. Now more young adults were experiencing a time of freedom before settling down. A new youth culture developed, which included going to parties and dance clubs, listening to popular music, and driving fast cars.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c19b19ef72454420aa46edb1676cf77d">For many young Americans, access to education was an important part of this new independence. High school attendance doubled during the decade. The percentage of students going on to college was higher in the United States than in any other country. This included women, who were attending college in higher numbers than ever before.</p>
        <p data-uuid="911da8a6b06945bf864c72322d9d5fb5"> The number of women in the work force continued to grow as well. Women with college degrees worked as nurses, teachers, librarians, and social workers.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6251b4d4b96b4f9bba7e53eeb295493d">Women were also finding new opportunities in politics. In 1923 suffrage leader Alice Paul introduced the Equal Rights Amendment to Congress, calling for equality of rights regardless of a person’s gender. The U.S. Senate passed the amendment 49 years later, but the states never ratified it. In 1925 Nellie Tayloe Ross (Wyoming) and Miriam “Ma” Ferguson (Texas) became the first women to serve as governors in the United States. Three years later, there were 145 women serving in state legislatures. Five women had won terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

By the end of the 1920s, less than 5 percent of the country’s doctors, lawyers, and architects were women. The percentage was small—but it was beginning to rise.<br />
