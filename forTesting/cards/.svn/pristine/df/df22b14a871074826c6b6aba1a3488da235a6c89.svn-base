  <p data-uuid="54856259830e4c6b82834c17a59d5da4">Hamilton and Jefferson did not cooperate for long. Instead, they began to disagree about how to define the authority of the central government. Hamilton believed in a strong federal government. Jefferson wanted to protect the powers of the states. Their conflict reflected basic differences in their opinions about democracy. Hamilton had little faith in the average individual. He once said that “the people . . . seldom judge or determine [decide] right.”</p> 
  <h3 data-uuid="d50004f1ff5944c4ae8820b982295aa3">Differing Views</h3> 
  <p data-uuid="842eab60828c4c4cb8197e4ef8c848d4">Hamilton wanted a strong central government that balanced power between the “mass of the people” and wealthier citizens. He believed that his approach would protect everyone’s liberties while keeping the people from having too much power.</p> 
  <p data-uuid="99218e41441d468ba24719efbe2d27aa">Jefferson disagreed strongly with Hamilton’s views of the average citizen’s ability to make decisions for the country. He admitted that “the people can not be all, and always, well informed.” However, Jefferson believed that it was the right of the people to rule the country.</p>

  <p data-uuid="0bce0b33735940a888757eb65727cdae"> Hamilton and Jefferson also fought over how the country’s economy should grow. Hamilton wanted new forms of economic growth. He wanted to promote manufacturing and business. He even suggested that the government award a prize to companies that made excellent products.<br /> </p> 
  <p data-uuid="47a848e3e6c646688427c37bb194bc97">In addition, Hamilton wanted to pass higher tariffs. Known as protective tariffs, these taxes would raise the prices of foreign products. Hamilton hoped this would cause Americans to buy U.S. goods. As a result, American manufacturing would be protected from foreign competition.</p> 
  <p data-uuid="9aa4e146eedb4f1fba99ff5d4748f639">Jefferson worried about depending too much on business and manufacturing. He believed that farmers were the most independent voters. They did not depend on other people’s work to make a living.</p> 
  <p data-uuid="23fd2394a3084e09859a3a5df0402e9c"> Jefferson wrote, “Our governments will remain virtuous [pure] for many centuries; as long as they are chiefly agricultural.” Jefferson wanted to help farmers by keeping the costs of the goods they bought low. Lower tariffs would help keep prices low.<br /> </p>
