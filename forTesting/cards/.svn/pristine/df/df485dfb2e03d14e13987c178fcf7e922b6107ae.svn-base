            that Warren Harding had won the presidential election held that day. Just one
            year later, stations broadcast the action from the 1921 World Series. One
            newspaper writer predicted, “It might not be too long before farmers at the
            four corners of the Union may sit in their own houses and hear the president of
            the United States.” Such an event seemed amazing to Americans in the early
            1900s. But it quickly became a reality. Soon, hundreds of radio stations began
            broadcasting all over the United States.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f4665e585fc34e26bba2e517228c3d6f">National radio networks, such as the National Broadcasting Company (NBC)
            and Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), allowed people all over the country to
            listen to the same programs. People suddenly had access to music, news, weather
            reports, children’s bedtime stories, sports broadcasts, and political speeches
            without leaving their homes. Business owners loved this technology. It allowed
            their advertisements to reach millions of listeners. Radio helped build a new
            national culture by allowing Americans everywhere to share common experiences.<br />

                        station in 1920, radio stations popped up throughout the country. By 1922 there were more than 600 stations in
                        the United States, all vying for a share of the many households who were
                        snapping up radios. Throughout the Roaring Twenties, families would gather
                        around their new radios to listen to their favorite programs. And by 1928 more
                        than 8 million American households had purchased a radio.</p>

        <p data-uuid="00c12220adde4af6a4e1ab645f36505f">Movies also became a major national passion in the 1920s. Early motion
            pictures had no sound. However, they opened a new world of exciting adventures
            for audiences. People packed theaters to see Westerns, romances, and stories
            about bootlegging gangsters. The 1927 movie <i>The Jazz Singer </i>thrilled
            movie fans. In the movie, actor Al Jolson shouted the line “You ain’t heard
            nothin’ yet!” This was the first <b><dfn title="talkie">talkie</dfn></b>, or motion
            picture with sound.<br />

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="3829dc96344f4c01a326922984e16e03">When <i>The Jazz
                    Singer </i>premiered at Warners’ Theatre in New York City on October 6, 1927,
                    it became an instant success. Although most of the film was silent, to the movie-going public, the brief sound during the film meant that the “talkies” had
                    arrived.</p>

        <p data-uuid="bf9a9fe170d2433cbcc82fa8d772bf9c">The
            movies quickly became big business. By the end of the decade, Americans were
            buying 95 million movie tickets each week. This was an amazing figure,
            considering that the U.S. population was only 123 million.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e022ffbd1e8046f082954c8719d7dcd0">Young
            movie fans copied hair and clothing styles of movie stars. Fans felt a personal
            connection to stars like Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, and Mary Pickford,
            who was known as “America’s Sweetheart.” Few fans at the time realized that
            Pickford was also a smart businesswoman. She was one of the highest-paid actors
            in Hollywood and a founder of United Artists, one of the nation’s most
            successful film companies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="48eebdecf009495e882ed257117a070d">Movie
            stars were not the only national heroes. Fans packed baseball stadiums to watch
            the great players of the 1920s, especially George Herman “Babe” Ruth. Ruth
            shattered home-run records, drawing thousands of new fans to the sport. Because
            baseball was segregated, African American players and business leaders started
            their own league. Negro League stars such as Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson are
            considered to be among the best baseball players in history.</p>
        <p data-uuid="53a4ad67c67e440ab41387eff059ff80">Fans
            always loved to see athletes break records. In 1926 American swimmer Gertrude
            Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel between England and
            France. Ederle beat the men’s world record by almost two hours.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1cde1ca75390447fb5d7d1a788d2a9e2">
            Pilots
            also became national heroes in the 1920s. Charles Lindbergh dominated the
            national news in 1927. He completed the first nonstop solo flight across the
            Atlantic Ocean, traveling from New York to Paris. A few years later, Amelia
            Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.<br />
