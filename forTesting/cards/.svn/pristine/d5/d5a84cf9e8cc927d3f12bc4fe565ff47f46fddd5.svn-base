        <p data-uuid="fdf212870106475595581d5efd210b70">The French and Indian War had drastically changed the balance of power in North America. The French and Spanish had lost a large expanse of valuable land to the British. Both countries were delighted to see their powerful rival experiencing trouble in its American colonies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="52a338471e9a4f6ab54477fc1c467bc7">The victory at Saratoga gave the Patriots something they had been desperately seeking: foreign help. Not surprisingly, it came from Britain’s enemies, France and Spain. Even Britain’s old ally, Holland, joined the fight on the side of the Patriots.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="d824d21c4a8f4df7bd32519e6c686285">Two Remarkable Europeans</h3>
        <p data-uuid="e992edbd56aa40a99685f165e2b86130">“The welfare of America is closely bound up with the welfare of mankind,” declared a wealthy young Frenchman, the <b><dfn title="Lafayette, Marquis de">Marquis de Lafayette</dfn></b>. Inspired by the ideas of the Revolution, Lafayette bought his own ship and arrived in America in 1777. He brought with him a group of well-trained soldiers and volunteered to serve in the Continental army himself without pay.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7dbf15d37f3240e3b14a2be9cc18a316">Lafayette spoke little English and had never seen battle. However, he quickly became a skillful commander, earning the title of major general. Lafayette led 2,000 Patriots to successfully pursue 6,000 Redcoats throughout Virginia during 1780–81. He gave $200,000 of his own money to support the Revolution and wrote many letters home to powerful friends and family asking their aid for the Patriot cause.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a80b1544428f41f78df0858a5cd00f5d"> In February 1778 another European came to serve heroically under Washington. <b><dfn title="Steuben, Baron Friedrich von">Baron Friedrich von Steuben</dfn></b>, an experienced military officer from Prussia, led with a combination of respect and fear. He started training the American troops, focusing on basic military drills. Soon he turned the Continental army into a finely tuned fighting force. A historian called von Steuben’s feat “perhaps the most remarkable achievement in rapid military training in the history of the world.”<br />

        <p data-uuid="5d024995df2a475ca8b1b1cf4d6f0910">Benjamin Franklin, a skilled and experienced diplomat, had gone to France in 1776 to ask for support from King Louis XVI. Finally, the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 persuaded the French king that the colonists could win the war. Not until then did the king agree to an alliance with the Patriots.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ded0c58417064105a2216aa2b28546a7">In May 1778 the Continental Congress ratified the treaty of support with France. The French had been helping the Patriots all along with supplies and ammunition. After the treaty became official, the French increased the level of supplies and agreed to provide soldiers and ships. The French naval support would be a key strategic ingredient in defeating the British.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e85424d922164ac594117d5e1cc35096">Help from Spain</h3>
        <p data-uuid="42270e9f639f44a6ad7e272b13e7f885"> Spain, also a bitter enemy of Britain, joined the war in 1779. <b><dfn title="G&#225;lvez, Bernardo de">Bernardo de G&#225;lvez</dfn></b>, the governor of Spanish Louisiana, became a key ally to the Patriots. G&#225;lvez gathered a small army of Spanish soldiers, French Americans, colonists, and Native Americans. Together they made their way east from Louisiana. G&#225;lvez seized British posts all the way to Pensacola, Florida.</p>
