            economic prosperity as the 2000 presidential election neared. The Democrats
            chose <b><dfn title="Gore, Al">Al Gore</dfn></b>, who had served as Bill Clinton’s
            vice-president, as their nominee. The Republican candidate was Texas governor <b><dfn title="Bush, George W.">George W. Bush</dfn></b>, the son of former

        <h3 data-uuid="c818d596d8124de7aae272a9d6d947bf">Campaign Issues</h3>
        <p data-uuid="cf0e6260cfc14674a6be803e62c20957">One major campaign issue was how to use the federal
            budget surplus, which totaled nearly $100 billion in 1999. Gore said he would
            put more money into education and health care, and use some of the surplus to
            pay off a part of the national debt. Bush promised to return the money to
            taxpayers through tax cuts. Bush and Gore also debated the role that the United
            States—now the world’s only superpower—should play in global affairs. Campaign
            polls showed that the race was very close.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c1b00b8ab3334e4f8a7fd189c26275da">On election night, the voting in some states was so
            close that no winner could be declared right away. It was so close in Florida
            that the votes had to be recounted. A machine recount found that Bush had
            received a few hundred more votes than Gore. But Gore supporters wanted the
            votes in four counties to be counted by hand. They argued that this would
            ensure all votes were counted. The Bush campaign challenged this in court.<br />

        <p data-uuid="a6bc41ad7c9b49e79f41627b76c19dd9">After several weeks of suspense, the Supreme
            Court ruled. The Supreme Court said that the manual recounts could not ensure
            that all votes would be counted the same way. They ordered the recount to stop.
            Florida’s 25 electoral votes went to Bush, making him the winner of the
            election with 271 electoral votes to Gore’s 266. The final popular vote tally
            was 50,459,211 for Bush and 51,003,894 for Gore. Bush was the first president
            in more than 100 years to win the electoral vote but lose the popular vote.</p>

            bitterness between Democrats and Republicans. Republicans held a small majority
            in the House of Representatives, while the Senate was split 50–50. When votes
            in the Senate are tied, the vice-president casts the tiebreaking vote. This
            gave Vice President Dick Cheney an important role in helping to pass Republican
            legislation.</p>
