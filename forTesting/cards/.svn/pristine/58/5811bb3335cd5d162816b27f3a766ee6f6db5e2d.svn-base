            <p data-uuid="ae57b73f63b1498b8ec503191743d344">In the early to mid-1800s, there were many changes in
                American society due to the goals of social reformers. These reformers made
                changes in the lives of immigrants, African Americans, and women. They also
                made changes to society as a whole including improving education and the prison
                system. New ways of thinking changed society, too, for example, transcendentalism.
                Changes in arts and culture also occurred with new movements in art and
                literature.</p>
            <h6 data-uuid="ab6cc80c8e4f425a97e079acd46781b0">Task</h6>
            <p data-uuid="70ffe50f13704d1a8c1e766a70b6bf73">Many of the reformers of this time were excellent
                speakers, essayists, and journalists. They used their power with words to share
                the message of the reforms they wished to make. Write a presentation in which you
                inform your audience of the goals and work of reform movements in the United
                States in the early 1800s.</p>
