By joining forces with others, they hoped to pressure employers into paying better wages and improving working conditions. With <b><dfn title="collective bargaining">collective bargaining</dfn></b>—all workers acting collectively, or together—workers had a much greater chance of success in negotiating with management. Most employers opposed collective bargaining. One company president said, “I shall never give in. I would rather go out of business.”</p>

It pushed for an eight-hour workday, equal pay for equal work, and an end to child labor. Union members also wanted the government to regulate trusts. In its early years, the Knights discouraged strikes, preferring tactics such as boycotts and negotiations. Yet soon enough, strikes would become commonplace.</p>

The AFL was founded by members of craft unions who were unhappy with how the Knights of Labor represented their interests. While the Knights organized individual workers, the AFL organized unions, such as the mineworkers’ and steelworkers’ unions. The AFL also limited its membership to skilled workers. This gave the union great bargaining power but left out most workers. The AFL tried to get better wages, hours, and working conditions for laborers. By 1890 the AFL’s membership was larger than that of the Knights. Using strikes and other tactics, the AFL won wage increases and shorter workweeks. <br />

He worked as a cigar maker and joined a local union, eventually becoming its president. In time, the cigar-makers’ union was reorganized and later joined the American Federation of Labor. Gompers became the AFL’s first president and remained so, except for the year 1895, until his death. He campaigned for basic trade-union rights, such as the right to picket and to organize boycotts and strikes. His efforts on behalf of workers helped organized labor to gain respect.</p>
