            furs with the Iroquois and other Native American groups. The center of the fur
            trade in New Netherland was the town of New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. The
            colonists traded Dutch goods with the Native Americans for furs and land.</p>

            Generous
            land grants to patroons, or lords, and religious tolerance soon brought Jews,
            French Huguenots, Puritans, and others to New Netherland. The patroons brought
            at least 50 new settlers to the colony. Following the Dutch patroon system, the
            settlers farmed the patroon’s land and paid him rent. Director-general <b><dfn title="Stuyvesant (STY-vi-suhnt), Peter">Peter Stuyvesant</dfn></b> (STY-vuh-suhnt)

            Dutch West India Company. Over time, the population of enslaved Africans
            increased in the colony. Many were forced to work on farms, in shops, and in
            homes. Others had to help build ships and work on loading docks. The Dutch West
            India Company freed some enslaved Africans. Others were able to buy their freedom.</p>

            King
            Charles II of England wanted to take over the growing colony of New Netherland
            so England could control the entire Atlantic coast of North America. In 1664 an
            English fleet captured the undefended colony without firing a single shot. New
            Netherland was renamed New York, and New Amsterdam became New York City.&#160;</p>

        <p data-uuid="51e6554b0a8a4c7fbf84b6cec3aaac46">Soon after the
            English conquest in 1664, the Duke of York made Sir George Carteret and Lord
            John Berkeley proprietors of New Jersey. This colony occupied lands between the
            Hudson and Delaware rivers. It had a diverse population, including Dutch,
            Swedes, Finns, and Scots. The fur trade was important to the economies of New
            York and New Jersey through the end of the 1600s.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9af5446fb1ca4279bfcd2ccf08a6b233">In the early 1700s
            New York’s African population grew. By 1723 more than 6,000 Africans—both free
            and enslaved—lived in the colony. However, free and enslaved Africans had fewer
            rights under English rule than under the Dutch. It was difficult for enslaved
            Africans to earn their freedom under English laws. Because they were mistreated
            and lived under harsh conditions, some resisted slavery. </p>
        <p data-uuid="dbcb2b5d4baf4d8a8f6f113e0b67cc30">
            In
            1712 a group of enslaved Africans led an armed revolt to escape from slavery.
            This uprising became known as the New York Slave Revolt of 1712. The resistors
            failed to gain their freedom, however. As a result, harsher laws were passed to
            prevent future revolts.</p>
