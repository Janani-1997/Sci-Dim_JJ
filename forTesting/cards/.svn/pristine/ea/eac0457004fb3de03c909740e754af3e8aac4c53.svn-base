            communism and the Soviet Union, which he called an “evil empire.” He saw the
            Cold War as a fight of “good versus evil, right versus wrong.”<br />

            countries in the 1980s as communism spread in the area. Reagan supported
            anti-Communist governments in El Salvador and Guatemala with financial aid.
            Critics of this policy charged that the aid went to military governments that
            committed major human rights violations.<br />

        <p data-uuid="445c807b359140b7a1c6091094c88979">In Nicaragua, a revolutionary group called the
            Sandinistas overthrew the country’s pro-American dictator in 1979. U.S. leaders
            became concerned when the Sandinistas formed closer ties with Communist Cuba.
            Reagan cut all U.S. aid to Nicaragua and began supporting anti-Sandinista
            rebels known as the Contras. This led to fears that the United States could be
            drawn into war. In 1984 Congress passed a ban on more U.S. military aid to the
            Contras.&#160;<br />

            secretly found a way to continue funding the Contras. One member of the group
            was Oliver North, a marine officer serving as a national security aide. North
            helped arrange the sale of U.S. missiles to Iran. In exchange, Iran released
            U.S. hostages who had been taken by terrorists loyal to Iran. Profits from this
            secret deal were sent to the Contras. These profits were in violation of the
            congressional ban. This series of events became known as the <b><dfn title="Iran-Contra affair">Iran-Contra affair</dfn></b>.</p>

            The Iran-Contra Affair became a national controversy when it was exposed
            in 1986. Congressional hearings concluded that President Reagan was not guilty
            of illegal activity. Several White House officials, however, were convicted of
            crimes related to the affair.<br />

            a tough stand against the Soviet Union. He stopped arms negotiations and
            quickly expanded the U.S. military.</p>
        <p data-uuid="66910e9d1bbf4cbf9ba96c0281b302dd">
            The Soviet Union tried to keep up with American spending in the arms
            race. This contributed to desperate economic times in the Soviet Union during
            the 1980s. In 1985 <b><dfn title="Gorbachev, Mikhail">Mikhail Gorbachev</dfn></b>
            became the new Soviet leader. To deal with his country’s economic problems, he
            began a process of political and economic reforms called <i>perestroika</i>. He
            also adopted a new policy of political openness called <i>glasnost</i>. The
            newfound freedoms introduced by Gorbachev’s policies threatened other leaders
            of the Soviet Union. But most of its citizens and leaders in the West supported
            these freedoms.</p>

                            be sure, we in the West must resist Soviet expansion. So we must maintain
                            defenses of unassailable strength. Yet we seek peace; so we must strive to
                            reduce arms on both sides. Beginning 10 years ago, the Soviets challenged the
                            Western alliance with a grave new threat, hundreds of new and more deadly SS-20
                            nuclear missiles, capable of striking every capital in Europe. The Western
                            alliance responded by committing itself to a counterdeployment unless the
                            Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution; namely, the elimination of such
                            weapons on both sides. For many months, the Soviets refused to bargain in
                            earnestness. As the alliance, in turn, prepared to go forward with its
                            counterdeployment, there were difficult days—days of protests like those during
                            my 1982 visit to this city—and the Soviets later walked away from the table.</p>
