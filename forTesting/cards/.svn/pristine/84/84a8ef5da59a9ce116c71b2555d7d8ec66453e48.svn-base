        <p data-uuid="9cebc2901fb0485eba0ec86c14e60ef1">When Jefferson took office, he brought with him a style and political ideas different from those of Adams and Washington. Jefferson was less formal than his predecessors, and he wanted to limit the powers of government.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="7de8cbec3a374f2a9f1143b509db70c2">Jefferson Is Inaugurated</h3>
        <p data-uuid="8dc19917e39647c2984e922491330959">Americans looked forward with excitement to Jefferson’s first speech as president. People from across the nation gathered in the new capital, Washington, DC, to hear him. Curious travelers looked with pride at the partially completed Capitol and at the executive mansion (not yet called the White House). The two buildings dominated the surrounding homes and forests.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b8a86377075c4b92960807db14238a64">Small businesses dotted the landscape. At one of these, a modest boardinghouse, the president-elect was putting the finishing touches on his speech. On the morning of March 4, 1801, he left the boardinghouse and walked to the Capitol. The leader of a republic, Jefferson believed, should not ride in fancy carriages.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9b761ec1799940e0ad33930a4ee53b08"> Jefferson read his speech in a quiet voice. He wanted to make it clear that he supported the will of the majority. He also stressed the need for a limited government and the protection of civil liberties.</p>

        <p data-uuid="7c37bb6260194d26943ff13c606975f3">From these humble surroundings in which Jefferson delivered his speech, Washington eventually grew into a large and impressive city. Over the years, the Capitol and the executive mansion were joined by other state buildings and monuments. Jefferson, who had long dreamed of a new national capital that would be independent of the interests of any one state, was pleased to be a part of this process of building a federal city.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="9326a762ce0a438299fe88bb8561b43e">Jefferson Makes Changes</h3>
        <p data-uuid="abfbb00aa4814b17a70e4fe80163e98f">President Jefferson faced the task of putting his Republican ideas into practice. One of his first actions was to select the members of his cabinet. His choices included James Madison as secretary of state and Albert Gallatin as secretary of the treasury.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5387341f1b2048e98838be03f7414718">Jefferson would also benefit from the Democratic-Republican Party’s newly won control of both houses of Congress. At Jefferson’s urging, Congress allowed the hated Alien and Sedition Acts to expire. Jefferson lowered military spending and reduced the size of the army. The navy was cut to seven active ships. Jefferson and Gallatin hoped that saving this money would allow the government to repay the national debt. Jefferson also asked Gallatin to find ways to get rid of domestic taxes, like the tax on whiskey. The Democratic-Republican–led Congress passed the laws needed to carry out these policies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="716d96f6908a4ac8ab6ec889cfac32a2">The entire national government in 1801 consisted of only several hundred people. Jefferson preferred to keep it that way. He believed that the primary functions of the federal government were to protect the nation from foreign threats, deliver the mail, and collect customs duties.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8d74325afa924cbab41bd0aadabe0762"> Jefferson did recognize that some of the Federalist policies—such as the creation of the Bank of the United States—should be kept. Although Jefferson had battled Hamilton over the Bank, as president, he agreed to leave it in place.</p>
