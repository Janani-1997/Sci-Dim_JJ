        <p data-uuid="de12a90a209146058836b78d3c496b24"> The American colonies had taken a bold step in declaring their independence from Great Britain in July 1776. Their next political goal was to form a new government. To do so, the American people drew from a wide range of political ideas, including ideas from the nation they had just broken away from. Centuries earlier, England had limited the power of its kings and queens in two documents. These were the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights. The <dfn title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</dfn>,<b> </b>or the Great Charter, was signed by King John in 1215. The document made the king subject to the law just like anyone else and set limits on his power. Compare the language in this excerpt from the Magna Carta with similar language in the Constitution:</p>

        <p data-uuid="e9301925c0d542ed8afdbf5effbd6430">The English Bill of Rights, passed in 1689, declared the supremacy of Parliament. It kept the king or queen from changing laws without Parliament's consent. As a result, the people's representatives had a strong voice in England's government. The English Bill of Rights took even more power away from the monarch than did the Magna Carta. It also protected the rights of English citizens. Notice how this statement about the rights of people accused of crimes is repeated almost exactly in the U.S. Constitution: </p>

        <p data-uuid="4617c403a62947d282451814d6ba11e1">Many Americans were also influenced by the Enlightenment—a philosophical movement that emphasized the use of reason to examine old ideas and traditions. English philosopher John Locke supported the movement toward self-government. He believed that a social contract existed between political rulers and the people they ruled. According to Locke, government could exist only with “the consent of the people.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="788797283c0b4a908b4ea57ff7f8b7d4">Another influential Enlightenment thinker was French philosopher Baron de Montesquieu. Montesquieu argued that the only way to achieve liberty was through the separation of governmental powers.</p>

        <p data-uuid="84f2caf274ba4b8bad845bf1e3af41ab">Americans had their own models of self-government to follow, such as town meetings, the Virginia House of Burgesses, and the Mayflower Compact. In 1639 the people of Connecticut drew up the English colonies’ first written <dfn title="constitution">constitution</dfn>.<b> </b>A constitution is a set of basic principles and laws that states the powers and duties of the government. In addition, the Declaration of Independence clearly set forth the beliefs on which Americans thought government should be based, such as the importance of laws to protect individual rights.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7ce3fa4e3bfe4a978586f4c590078277">To keep individual leaders from gaining too much power, the new state constitutions created limited governments by restricting the power of government officials to take certain actions. The constitutions also supported the principle known as the <i>rule of law</i>, which requires that every citizen obey the laws, including political leaders. Most state constitutions had rules to protect the rights of citizens or those accused of crimes. Some banned slavery. The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 is the oldest state constitution still in effect.</p>
        <p data-uuid="02e852d3a70d4463979242aaf1c8c5e3"> Thomas Jefferson's views on religious freedom were included in the <dfn title="Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom">Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom</dfn>.<b> </b>This document declared that no person could be forced to attend a particular church or be required to pay for a church with tax money. Jefferson’s idea of a separation of church and state is also reflected in the U.S. Constitution:</p>
