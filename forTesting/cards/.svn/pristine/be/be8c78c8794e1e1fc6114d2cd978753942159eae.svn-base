        <p data-uuid="18af2618588b4514abf118dfa999c277">Eli Whitney’s cotton gin made cotton growing very profitable. Soon, cotton farming spread across the South. Since it required a lot of labor to grow cotton, the need for enslaved people grew as the number of cotton farms increased. By the mid-1800s, enslaved African Americans accounted for about one-third of the population of the South. </p>

        <p data-uuid="c59924ce0fe94d5a876f440feb7e60f6">Work dominated the lives of enslaved people. Men, women, and children were forced to work whenever their slaveholders demanded. For most slaves this meant every day of their lives from sunrise to sunset. Even sickness and poor weather rarely served as reasons to stop working.</p>
        <p data-uuid="794a1e610ffc471f84a779a590ca7ee8">The majority of enslaved people lived and worked on farms or large plantations in the South, where cotton was the leading crop. Many slaves worked as field hands. They planted, tended, picked, and processed cotton. They also cleared land, repaired buildings and fences, and performed many of the other tasks needed to keep the farms and plantations running. Slaves who worked outside were supervised by <b><dfn title="overseer">overseers</dfn></b>. These were men that farmers and planters hired to watch over and direct the work of slaves. Other slaves worked in the plantation owners’ homes. They performed a wide variety of servant duties, such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare. Some enslaved people learned a trade. They worked as bricklayers, blacksmiths, and carpenters.</p>

Her father was not at home. When he came, which was while the slaves were eating in the kitchen, she told him about it. He came down, called my mother out, and, with a hickory rod, he beat her fifteen or twenty strokes, and then called his daughter and told her to take her satisfaction of her, and she did beat her until she was satisfied. Oh! it was dreadful, to see the girl whom my poor mother had taken care of from her childhood thus beating her, and I must stand there, and did not dare to crook my finger in her defence.”</span></span></p>

        <p data-uuid="25feda3684b44621a5a84236f8b71f20">Enslaved African Americans who worked in the fields on plantations usually lived in terrible conditions. They were housed in tiny cabins with leaky roofs and dirt floors. The food and clothing they were given were equally as poor. When they were sick they rarely, if ever, received medical care.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1f138c2fd4c84d33bd1ab17728268454"> Some slaveholders provided better living conditions than others. Generally, they did this to gain obedience, not out of a sense of compassion. Most slaveholders, however, treated their slaves harshly. They used a wide variety of punishments to ensure obedience, including beatings, withholding food, and threatening family members. Wes Brady recalled the punishments faced by field hands:</p>

        <p data-uuid="c65d96de1edc4f108772a9c959cd590a">Perhaps the cruelest part of slavery was the sale of family members away from one another. Although some slaveholders would not separate mothers from children, many did, causing unforgettable grief. When enslaved families could manage to be together, they took comfort in family life. Enslaved people did marry each other, although their marriages were not legally recognized. They tried to raise children while knowing that their children could be taken from them and sold at any time. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who was born into slavery, recalled visits from his mother, who lived 12 miles away.</p>
