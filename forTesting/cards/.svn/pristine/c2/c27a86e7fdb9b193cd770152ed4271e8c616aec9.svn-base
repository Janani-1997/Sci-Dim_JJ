            in the early 1800s was changing fast. In the North, workshops run by the
            craftspeople who owned them were being replaced by large-scale factories owned by businesspeople and staffed by hired workers. In the South, small family
            farms began to give way to large cotton plantations, owned by wealthy white
            people and worked by enslaved African Americans. Wealth seemed to be
            concentrating into fewer hands. Many ordinary Americans felt left behind.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6e62babd416b44cb860d6c0d3d35495c">These
            same people also began to believe they were losing power in their government.
            In the late 1700s some Americans thought that government was best managed by
            wealthy, property-owning men. Government policies seemed targeted to help build
            their power. The result was a growing belief that the wealthy were tightening
            their grip on power.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9e07ce6d48a34e6c8095d3dad0827a52">
            Hoping for change, small farmers, frontier settlers, and slaveholders
            rallied behind reformer Andrew Jackson, the popular hero of the War of 1812 and
            presidential candidate in the 1824 election. Even though he was a political
            leader, they believed Jackson would defend the rights of the common people and
            the slave states. They had been disappointed in the way Jackson had lost the
            1824 election because
            of a decision in the House of Representatives. Jackson’s supporters felt his
            policies and philosophies represented a move toward greater democratization.</p>

            <p data-uuid="6a9ab64b24974c7f9438edf37c8eabee">Jackson was born
                in Waxhaws, a region along the border of the North and South Carolina colonies.
                In 1788 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, which was still a part of North
                Carolina. There he built a mansion called the Hermitage. He lived in Washington
                as president, then retired to the Hermitage, where he died. </p>
            <p data-uuid="9d8bf423d7454db29265520d2a6f09ef">Jackson had no
                formal education, but he taught himself law and became a successful lawyer. He
                became Tennessee’s first representative to the U.S. Congress and also served in
                the Senate. Jackson became a national hero when his forces defeated the Creek
                and Seminole Indians. He went on to battle the British in the Battle of New
                Orleans during the War of 1812. Jackson was elected as the nation’s seventh
                president in 1828 and served until 1837.</p>
            <p data-uuid="e23a0842fc2f42bdad753c0229feb50d">
                The
                presidency became more powerful during Jackson’s tenure. His
                belief in a strong presidency made him both loved and hated. He vetoed as many
                bills as the six previous presidents
                together. Jackson also believed in a strong Union. When South Carolina tried to
                nullify, or reject, a federal tariff, he threatened to send troops into the
                state to force it to obey.</p>

                    This tally sheet shows how each state’s electoral
                    votes were divided among the four candidates. None of them received the majority
                    of the votes so the House of Representatives had to choose the president.</p>

        <p data-uuid="2f22eefdede9476da8563eba8e63843c">In 1824 four men hoped to replace James Monroe as
            president. They were John Quincy Adams, William Crawford, Henry Clay, and
            Andrew Jackson. Jackson won the popular vote, but he did not receive a majority
            of electoral votes. According to the Constitution, if no person wins a majority
            of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives must choose the president.
            The selection was made from the top three vote-getters. Clay came in fourth and
            was out of the running. In the House vote, he threw his support to Adams, who
            then won. Because Adams later named Clay as his secretary of state, Jackson’s
            supporters claimed that Adams gained the presidency by making a deal with Clay.
            Charges of a “corrupt bargain” followed Adams throughout his term. Adams had
            many plans for his presidency. But Congress, led by Jackson supporters,
            defeated his proposals.</p>

            democratic reforms were made. Some states changed their qualifications for
            voters to grant more white males suffrage. The revised rules, although they
            extended the franchise of voting to more white men, usually excluded free
            blacks from voting as they had been allowed under original state constitutions.
