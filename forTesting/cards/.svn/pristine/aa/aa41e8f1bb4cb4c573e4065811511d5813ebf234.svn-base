        <p data-uuid="5400914a783649f4b3e67a06cf9c0f97">As unemployment skyrocketed, more and more Americans struggled just to feed themselves and their families. Hungry people searched city dumps for scraps of food. One woman remembered taking off her glasses when she cooked so she could not see the maggots in the meat her family was about to eat. Private charities, as well as state and local governments, set up soup kitchens and breadlines in New York and across the country. But the need far exceeded the available resources. Many people turned to President Herbert Hoover and the federal government to lead the relief effort. </p>
        <p data-uuid="4092fc2b435944f1b94c23f76ba1ee20"> Hoover knew that many Americans needed help. He did not believe, however, that it was the federal government’s role to provide direct relief to Americans. Hoover felt it was up to private individuals and institutions, not the government, to offer relief. Despite this belief, Hoover did implement some new government programs. In 1932 he created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). That year, the RFC loaned $1.2 billion to 5,000 different financial institutions, including banks and farm mortgage companies. Hoover continued to resist giving direct assistance to individuals.<br />

People bitterly referred to empty pockets turned inside out as Hoover flags. Groups of tin and cardboard shacks built by homeless families were nicknamed Hoovervilles. These camps were built in cities and towns across the United States from New York to Los Angeles.</p>

Called the <b><dfn title="Bonus Army">Bonus Army</dfn></b>, they had come to the capital to demand early payment of a military bonus. After the government denied the payment, most of the veterans returned home. About 2,000, however, stayed in their shantytown. </p>
        <p data-uuid="d6ac0009c7b4476b8dff030a66189a51"> President Hoover authorized General Douglas MacArthur to use U.S. troops to evict the Bonus Army. MacArthur used force, including tear gas and tanks, to scatter the veterans. Several veterans were killed. The public reacted with outrage to the government’s treatment of war veterans. Americans would have a chance to express this frustration in the upcoming election.</p>
