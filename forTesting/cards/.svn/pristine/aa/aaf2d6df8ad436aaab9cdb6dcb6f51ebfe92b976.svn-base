            had participated in the Freedom Rides and many marches. But in the mid-1960s,
            he broke with the goal of nonviolence. Carmichael was a founder of the <b><dfn title="Black Power">Black Power</dfn></b> movement, which
            called for African American independence. Black Power activists believed that
            blacks should reject integration, focusing instead on controlling their own
            communities.</p>

            helped inspire the Black Power movement. He was a leader of the Nation of
            Islam, an organization that combined ideas about African American independence
            with the teachings of Islam. Malcolm X argued that African Americans should
            work for social and political independence. He believed that African Americans
            had the right to defend themselves, using violence if necessary.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6d2371dc0f00418288e08bae286e72b8">In 1964 Malcolm X traveled to the Muslim holy city
            of Mecca, where he met Muslims of many races. He began to hope that different
            races could coexist in peace, although he still supported freedom “by any means
            necessary.” But in 1965 Malcolm X broke with the Nation of Islam and was killed
            by three of its members.<br />

            frustrated many members of the black community. In some U.S. cities, tensions exploded
            into violent, sometimes deadly, riots. One such riot occurred in August 1965 in
            the Watts section of Los Angeles. Twenty-four people were killed, and much of
            Watts was destroyed.<br />

            killed in Memphis, Tennessee. As televised reports spread the news of King’s
            assassination, furious rioters took to the streets in more than 100 American
            cities. The movement had lost its most visible leader.<br />
