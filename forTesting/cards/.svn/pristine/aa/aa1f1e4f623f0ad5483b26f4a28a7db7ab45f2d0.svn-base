        <p data-uuid="e1cf042b261849c584935abd3a4ef6f7">Americans had always believed they could build a new, better society founded on democratic principles. In 1839 writer John O’Sullivan noted, “We are the nation of human progress, and who will, what can, set limits to our onward march?”</p>
        <p data-uuid="67648bcf309c4e0fab97d55538d3c0c6"> Actually, there was one limit: land. By the 1840s the United States had a booming economy and population. Barely 70 years old, the nation already needed more room for farms, ranches, businesses, and ever-growing families. Americans looked West to what they saw as a vast wilderness, ready to be taken. With American settlers already living in Oregon, New Mexico, and Texas, many believed that the country should annex, or add those lands to the United States, giving Americans more lands into which they could spread.</p>

This idea that American expansion was inevitable proved very popular. However, it also caused political problems.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="4a8362418a114aed916e52c5b747e636">In the 1840s and 1850s, manifest destiny was tied up with the slavery issue. If America expanded, would slavery be allowed in the new territories? Several presidents became involved in the difficult issue, including President John Tyler. A pro-slavery Whig, Tyler wanted to increase the power of the southern slave states by annexing Texas. His fellow Whigs disagreed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d030b0aabcec4123b89ee1d1e42c12a9">In 1844 the Whig Party passed up Tyler and chose Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky as its presidential candidate. At first opposing annexation, Clay changed his mind due to pressure from southern politicians. The Democratic Party chose former Tennessee governor <b><dfn title="Polk, James K.">James K. Polk</dfn></b> to oppose Clay. Both candidates strongly favored acquiring Texas and Oregon.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4aa0d30fdc624c7e92a615b04d670608"> Southerners feared the loss of Texas, a possible new slave state. Others worried that Texas might become an ally of Britain. These concerns helped Polk narrowly defeat Clay.</p>

        <p data-uuid="89e62628a3e2485ca1ccc8fc3bb9168c">President Polk quickly set out to fulfill his campaign promise to annex Oregon and Texas. By the 1820s Russia and Spain had given up their claims to Oregon Country. Britain and the United States had agreed to occupy the territory together.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4332262d610243b399cb243d1c6d4382">As more Americans settled there, they began to ask that Oregon become part of the United States. Polk wanted to protect these settlers’ interests. Some politicians noted that Oregon Country would provide a Pacific port for the growing U.S. trade with China. Meanwhile, Britain and the United States disagreed over how to draw the United States–Canadian border. American expansionists cried, “Fifty-four forty or fight!” This slogan referred to 54&#176;40’ north latitude, the line to which Americans wanted their northern territory to extend.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f13b61d8717b47e4a79094bd497124eb"> Neither side really wanted a war, though. In 1846 Great Britain and the United States signed a treaty that gave the United States all Oregon land south of the forty-ninth parallel. This treaty drew the border that still exists today. Oregon became an organized U.S. territory in February 1848.</p>

        <p data-uuid="eb7c54157f9d4b6882e4e2dfc487d0ae"> By March 1845 Congress had approved annexation and needed only the support of the Republic of Texas. Texas politicians hoped that joining the United States would help solve the republic’s financial and military problems. The Texas Congress approved annexation in June 1845. Texas became part of the United States in December. This action angered the Mexican government, which considered Texas to be a “stolen province.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="252f4583ee1049089fb2c1b01deac3f7">Though it had lost Texas, Mexico still had settlements in other areas of the present-day Southwest to govern. New Mexico was the oldest settled area, with its capital at Santa Fe. Mexico also had settlements in present-day Arizona, Nevada, and California.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5dc282e8162a4ff0be5ee78dd80ea56c">During early Spanish rule, the mission system had dominated much of the present-day Southwest. Over time, it had become less important there, especially in New Mexico, where settlers lived in small villages. In California, however, missions remained the focus of everyday life. Missions under later Spanish rule carried out huge farming and ranching operations using the labor of Native Americans. Some of the Native Americans came willingly to the missions. Others were brought by force. Usually, they were not allowed to leave the mission once they had arrived. They had to adopt the clothing, food, and religion of the Spaniards.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b08725a8c5eb403f92e2c75616fb3155"> Missions often sold their goods to local pueblos, or towns, that arose near the missions and presidios. One wealthy California settler, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, remembered the early days.</p>

In 1833, for example, Mexico ended the mission system in California. Mission lands were broken up, and huge grants were given to some of the wealthiest California settlers, including Vallejo. They created vast ranchos, or ranches, with tens of thousands of acres of land. <b><dfn title="vaqueros">Vaqueros</dfn></b>, or cowboys, managed the large herds of cattle and sheep.

        <p data-uuid="e0c2773dbe3e4d849354464d4bd4eac2">Because of the great distance between California and the center of Mexico’s government, by the early 1820s California had only around 3,200 colonists. These early California settlers, called <b><dfn title="Californios">Californios</dfn></b>, felt little connection to their faraway government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6a615ed7f4d1432f85912cf5a6f36573">Many Californios made their living working on ranches. Land grants from the Mexican government allowed some, such as Mariano Gualdalupe Vallejo, to own their own ranches.<br />

            <p data-uuid="9683bf468fc7468aa839a73b5b4fa5da">Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo was born to an influential Californio family in Monterey. He joined the Mexican army shortly after Mexico’s independence from Spain. He was soon put in charge of Mexico’s efforts to increase settlement in northern California. Vallejo eventually became the richest man in California, owning enormous amounts of land and livestock. He welcomed American rule of California, believing it would result in self-government for Californios. Vallejo served at the state constitutional convention as well as in the first state senate.</p>

In <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i>, American novelist Richard Henry Dana Jr. wrote about his encounters with Californio culture. He described, for example, what happened after a Californio served a feast to Dana and a friend.<br />
