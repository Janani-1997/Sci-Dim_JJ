            their own governments. Each government was given power by a charter. The
            English monarch had ultimate authority over all of the colonies. A group of
            royal advisers called the Privy Council set English colonial policies.</p>

            Each colony had a governor who served as head of
            the government. Most governors were assisted by an advisory council. In royal colonies
            the English king or queen selected the governor and the council members. In
            proprietary colonies the proprietors chose all of these officials. In a few
            colonies, such as Connecticut, the people elected the governor.&#160;</p>

            representatives to help make laws and set policy. These officials served on
            assemblies. Each colonial assembly passed laws that had to be approved first
            by the advisory council and then by the governor.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6e5b808e7dc645fb883229092a807187">
            Established in 1619, Virginia’s assembly was the
            first colonial legislature in North America. At first it met as a single body,
            but it was later split into two houses. The first house was known as the
            Council of State. The governor’s advisory council and the Virginia Company
            selected its members. The House of Burgesses was the assembly’s second house.
            The members were elected by colonists.</p>

            people talked about and decided on issues of local interest, such as paying for
            schools.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f8b273e62fc6400aa08d6c8de97df56d">In the southern colonies people typically lived
            farther away from one another. Therefore, many decisions were made at the
            county level. The middle colonies used both county meetings and town meetings
            to make&#160;laws.</p>

            England</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3a52ee8c21064e25b28a32b181558b59">In 1685 James II became king of England. He was
            determined to take more control over the English government, both in England
            and in the colonies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7d9984070551444d8bdf2945aee44914">James believed that the colonies were too
            independent. In 1686 he united the northern colonies under one government
            called the Dominion of New England. James named Sir Edmund Andros royal
            governor of the Dominion. The colonists disliked Andros because he used his
            authority to limit the powers of town meetings.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="9dfecbbf30b64fa286c894416572a188">English Bill of Rights</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d2df0e6bc6c24c79a8e99bd94d334d7a">
            Parliament replaced the unpopular King James and
            passed the <b><dfn title="English Bill of Rights">English Bill of Rights</dfn></b>
            in 1689. This act reduced the powers of the English monarch. At the same time,
            Parliament gained power. As time went on, the colonists valued their own right
            to elect representatives to decide local issues. Following these changes, the
            colonies in the Dominion quickly formed new assemblies and charters.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="febcdb43b67940d1b22e2b8e3c878311">Colonial Courts</h3>
        <p data-uuid="62a87a908f3744d9909fe1aecf2a96a0">Colonial courts made up another important part
            of colonial governments. Whenever possible, colonists used the courts to
            control local affairs. In general, the courts reflected the beliefs of their
            local communities. For example, many laws in Massachusetts enforced the
            Puritans’ religious beliefs. Laws based on the Bible set the standard for the
            community’s conduct.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1aaa6e6626d345f58ea1b44ec5efe434">
            Sometimes colonial courts also protected individual
            freedoms. For example, in 1733 officials arrested John Peter Zenger for
            printing statements that criticized the governor of New York. The governor
            claimed that these statements were false. Andrew Hamilton, Zenger’s attorney,
            argued that the statements were true and that he should be allowed to publish
            his opinions.&#160;<br />
