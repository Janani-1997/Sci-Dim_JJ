        <p data-uuid="18a5de2b6c524d6c8640a2732f1dfbf8">Furious at Lincoln’s election and fearing a federal invasion, seven southern states had seceded. The new Commander in Chief tried desperately to save the Union.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b12c66fed7244fb988108ef271fb8906">In his inaugural address, Lincoln promised not to end slavery where it existed. The federal government “will not assail [attack] you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,” he said, trying to calm southerners’ fears. However, Lincoln also stated his intention to preserve the Union. He believed that saving the Union would help to save democracy. If the Union and its government failed, then monarchs could say that people were unable to rule themselves. As a result, Lincoln refused to recognize secession, declaring the Union to be “unbroken.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="41f5cb66e0534ebd83a0011f0b979425"> In fact, after decades of painful compromises, the Union was badly broken. From the Lower South, a battle cry was arising, born out of fear, rage—and excitement. Confederate officials began seizing branches of the federal mint, arsenals, and military outposts. In a last- ditch effort to avoid war between the states, Secretary of State Seward suggested a united effort of threatening war against Spain and France for interfering in Mexico and the Caribbean. In the highly charged atmosphere, it would take only a spark to unleash the heat of war.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f4071899a11145499b50acf4b947c614">In 1861 that spark occurred at <b><dfn title="Fort Sumter">Fort Sumter</dfn></b>. This federal outpost in Charleston, South Carolina, was attacked by Confederate troops, beginning the Civil War. Determined to seize the fortress—which controlled the entrance to Charleston Harbor—the Confederates ringed the harbor with heavy guns. Instead of surrendering the fort, Lincoln decided to send in ships to provide badly needed supplies to defend the fort. Confederate officials demanded that the federal troops evacuate. The fort’s commander, Major Robert Anderson, refused.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a9f93dc6568b43f9bd1c8cbec192351d"> Now it was Jefferson Davis who faced a dilemma. If he did nothing, he would damage the image of the Confederacy as a sovereign, independent nation. On the other hand, if Davis ordered an attack on Fort Sumter, he would turn peaceful secession into war. Davis chose war. Before sunrise on April 12, 1861, Confederate guns opened fire on Fort Sumter. A witness wrote that the first shots brought “every soldier in the harbor to his feet, and every man, woman, and child in the city of Charleston from their beds.” The Civil War had begun.<br />

States now had to choose: Would they secede, or would they stay in the Union? Democratic senator Stephen Douglas, speaking in support of Lincoln’s call for troops, declared, “There can be no neutrals in this war, <i>only patriots</i>—or <i>traitors</i>.”<br />

The slave states of the Upper South provided soldiers and supplies to the rest of the South. The western territories were disputed between the Union and the Confederacy.

        <p data-uuid="894b1d323f4d421da1c611dd6b8123a4">Numbers tell an important story about the Civil War. Consider the North’s advantages. It could draw soldiers and workers from a population of 22 million. The South had only 5.5 million people to draw from. One of the greatest advantages in the North was the region’s network of roads, canals, and railroads. Some 22,000 miles of railroad track could move soldiers and supplies throughout the North. The South had only about 9,000 miles of track.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5250269e0951488bac7fe4559e8d9eed">In the North, the Civil War stimulated economic growth. To supply the military, the production of coal, iron, wheat, and wool increased. Also, the export of corn, wheat, beef, and pork to Europe doubled. In the South, the export of resources decreased because of the Union blockade.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e1a5f79df0094b61b337daf607d32927"> Finally, the Union had money. It had a more developed economy, banking system, and a currency called greenbacks. The South had to start printing its own Confederate dollars. Some states printed their own money, too. This led to financial chaos.<br />

        <p data-uuid="68e6a21e6fba490791dc22fc06b46386">The Confederacy had advantages as well. With its strong military tradition, the South put many brilliant officers into battle. Southern farms provided food for its armies. The South’s best advantage, however, was strategic. It needed only to defend itself until the North grew tired of fighting.</p>
        <p data-uuid="46d051f5b6264c7c83a6c0c882a2d86b">The North had to invade and control the South. To accomplish this, the Union army had to travel huge distances. For example, the distance from northern Virginia to central Georgia is about the length of Scotland and England combined. Because of distances such as this, the North had to maintain long supply lines.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bad3f3e9e73641dfa9efee30bd192f42">In addition, wilderness covered much of the South. Armies found this land difficult to cross. Also, in Virginia many of the rivers ran from east to west. Because of this, they formed a natural defense against an army that attacked from the north to the south. As a result, northern generals were often forced to attack Confederate troops from the side rather than from the front. Furthermore, because southerners fought mostly on their home soil, they were often familiar with the area.</p>
        <p data-uuid="04f0a68a0f734079a3dae3e01b88ff32"> The South hoped to wear down the North and to capture Washington, DC. Confederate president Jefferson Davis also tried to win foreign allies through <b><dfn title="cotton diplomacy">cotton diplomacy</dfn></b>. This was the idea that Great Britain would support the Confederacy because it needed the South’s raw cotton to supply its booming textile industry. Cotton diplomacy did not work as the South had hoped. Britain had large supplies of cotton, and it got more from India and Egypt.<br />
