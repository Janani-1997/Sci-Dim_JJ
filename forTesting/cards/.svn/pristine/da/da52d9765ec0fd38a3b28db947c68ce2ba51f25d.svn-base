            continued peace negotiations with the North Vietnamese. On January 27, 1973,
            the United States signed a cease-fire called the Paris Peace Accords with
            representatives of North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the Vietcong. The United
            States agreed to withdraw all its troops from Vietnam. North Vietnam agreed to
            return all American prisoners of war. Despite the peace agreement, fighting
            broke out between North and South Vietnam in 1974. The United States refused to
            send troops back to South Vietnam.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8282ae41b4774ede9b09e8e73dfbcb39">
            In 1975 North Vietnam invaded the South. Thousands of
            panic-stricken American Embassy workers and South Vietnamese scrambled to
            evacuate Saigon. “The city was in flames,” remembered one American worker. “And
            the Communists had the city surrounded with <br />
            missiles. . . . We realized that we
            were down to hours if not minutes.” Helicopters lifted many people to ships
            waiting off the coast.</p>

            Socialist Republic of Vietnam, uniting the former countries of North and South
            Vietnam. Hanoi became the capital, and Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d5e7c20f0a6842d78ba380e8eeea428b">Life remained extremely difficult in Vietnam after the war.
            Cities, villages, forests, and farms had been destroyed during the war. Some
            250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers died in the war. About 1 million North
            Vietnamese and Vietcong soldiers were killed. The number of civilians killed is
            estimated at 2 million. Hundreds of thousands of former soldiers, officials,
            and other professionals were forced to live in “re-education camps.” Another
            1.5 million Vietnamese fled the country. About half of them settled in the
            United States. Thousands of other refugees from Southeast Asia joined them,
            such as the Hmong of Laos. The Hmong fought bravely alongside the U.S. military
            against the Communists during the war. Communist dictators took over Laos and
            Cambodia in 1975. The Cambodian Communist army, the Khmer Rouge, killed about
            1.5 million people in a massive campaign to destroy supposed enemies of
            communism. </p>
        <p data-uuid="38dbd0f6154b41c385cc5c16d1057aa4">
            According to a 2007 U.S. Census survey, more than a
            million Vietnamese immigrants now live in the United States. Vietnamese,
            Laotian, and Cambodian immigrants to the United States have made significant
            contributions to the communities they join. Many of these communities are along
            the West and Gulf coasts.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b1b3e0c0cb094bc1aeaf180b33ca3748">The Vietnam War carried heavy costs for the United States as well.
            Some 58,000 Americans were killed, and more than 300,000 were wounded.</p>
        <p data-uuid="041e2dfc796843f3aa030df12c2423d5">Returning American soldiers were not always welcomed home as
            heroes as other war veterans had been. Some were insulted by antiwar
            protesters. As veterans struggled to readjust to civilian life, many suffered
            from post-traumatic stress disorder. This condition includes symptoms such as
            nightmares and flashbacks to traumatic experiences. Today, the U.S. government
            is more prepared to meet the needs of veterans with post-traumatic stress
            disorder. It offers counseling and information to vets and their families on
            how to deal with symptoms of trauma.</p>
        <p data-uuid="59798bf465434507aca3858818e84f5e">Another effect of the Vietnam War was that Americans had less
            trust in government officials, including the president. This led to the passage
            in 1973 of the <b><dfn title="War Powers Act">War Powers Act</dfn></b>.
            The act requires the president to get congressional approval before committing
            U.S. troops to an armed struggle.</p>
        <p data-uuid="be5054ec141a4122960e5147a3638af4">The war also left a dismal economic legacy, affecting the
            development of the United States. Some estimates place the cost to American
            taxpayers at more than $150 billion. This cost added to the national debt and
            fueled inflation. The money spent on the war used funds that might have gone to
            domestic programs, such as those that help the poor.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cbfb31012e0a46d9b00998f5d2bb1f5a">
            Americans took a step toward healing the wounds of the
            war with the 1982 dedication of the <b><dfn title="Vietnam Veterans Memorial">Vietnam
            Veterans Memorial</dfn></b>. Maya Ying Lin designed the black granite memorial.
            It lists the names of dead or missing American soldiers. Lin insisted that the
            names be listed in chronological order rather than in alphabetical order or by
            rank.</p>

Its main feature is a V-shaped wall inscribed with the names of more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers killed in the war. Initially, some thought the wall's simple design was not sufficiently respectful to the memory of fallen soldiers. Still, many
                        Vietnam veterans, their loved ones, and other visitors to the memorial have found the wall to be a deeply moving experience. Nearly every day, visitors leave offerings such as flowers, letters, dog tags, and photographs, at the memorial.</p>
