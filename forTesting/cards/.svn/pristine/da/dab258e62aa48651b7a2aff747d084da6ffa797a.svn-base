                    <p class="source" data-uuid="a7a8acf1fdf24684b2367a0def15efe2">Mary Antin and her family were Jewish. They moved from Russia to Boston in the 1890s to find religious freedom and to escape poverty. The Antin family had once been wealthy in Russia but had fallen into poverty due to illness. Antin’s father was the first to travel to the United States, where he worked for three years before bringing his wife and children from Russia. Here Antin describes her family’s arrival in America.</p>

The three small rooms into which my father now ushered us, up one flight of stairs, contained only the necessary beds, with lean mattresses; a few wooden chairs; a table or two; a mysterious iron structure, which later turned out to be a stove; a couple of unornamental kerosene lamps; and a scanty array of cooking-utensils and crockery. And yet we were all impressed with our new home and its furniture. . . . It was chiefly because these wooden chairs and tin pans were American chairs and pans that they shone glorious in our eyes. . . . Perhaps my mother alone, of us newcomers, appreciated the shabbiness of the little apartment, and realized that for her there was as yet no laying down of the burden of poverty.</p>

As we moved along in a little procession, I was delighted with the illumination of the streets. . . . People did not need to carry lanterns. In America, then, everything was free, as we had heard in Russia. Light was free; the streets were as bright as a synagogue on a holy day. Music was free; we had been serenaded, to our gaping delight, by a brass band of many pieces, soon after our installation on Union Place.

That subject my father had written about repeatedly, as comprising his chief hope for us children, the essence of American opportunity, the treasure that no thief could touch, not even misfortune or poverty. It was the one thing that he was able to promise us when he sent for us; surer, safer than bread or shelter.”</p>

The manufacturer who owns, say, from three or four to a dozen or more tenements <a href="[remark:8368e4b1b03f4ab4811c584020874fc9]">contiguous</a> to his shop, fills them up with these people, charging them outrageous rents, and . . . deals them out tobacco by the week, and devotes the rest of his energies to the paring down of wages to within a peg or two of the point where the tenant rebels in desperation. When he does rebel, he is given the alternative of submission, or eviction with the entire loss of employment . . . </p>

They contained thirty-five families of cigarmakers, with probably not half a dozen persons in the whole lot of them, outside of the children, who could speak a word of English, though many had been in the country half a lifetime. This room with two windows giving on the street, and a rear attachment without windows, called a bedroom by courtesy, is rented at $12.25 a month. In the front room man and wife work at the bench from six in the morning till nine at night. They make a team, stripping the tobacco leaves together; then he makes the filler, and she rolls the wrapper on and finishes the cigar. For a thousand they receive $3.75, and can turn out together three thousand cigars a week . . . The workers in these tenements are just now on a strike, demanding $5.00 and $5.50 for their work . . .While we are in the house, the ultimatum of the “boss” is received. He will give $3.75 a thousand, not another cent.“
