        <p data-uuid="40f4d10990434cc6aec96685f0c870af">While the two armies fought for control of the land, the Union navy controlled the sea. The North had most of the U.S. Navy’s small fleet, and many experienced naval officers had remained loyal to the Union. The North also had enough industry to build more ships. The Confederacy turned to British companies for new ships.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="b666d4b8256a4dfda3a65352ae0ca9ea">The Union’s Naval Strategy</h3>
        <p data-uuid="108b8fd177a24715aadfc641b3ff7535">The Union navy quickly mobilized to set up a blockade of southern ports. The blockade largely prevented the South from selling or receiving goods, and it seriously damaged the southern economy.</p>
        <p data-uuid="25f455c0c64b4ec1bfaedf3ac1a88241"> The blockade was hard to maintain because the Union navy had to patrol thousands of miles of coastline from Virginia to Texas. The South used small, fast ships to outrun the larger Union warships. Most of these blockade runners traveled to the Bahamas or Nassau to buy supplies for the Confederacy. These ships, however, could not make up for the South’s loss of trade. The Union blockade reduced the number of ships entering southern ports from 6,000 to 800 per year.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="bbfa0f42371249cca03b5387dadc4f90">Clash of the Ironclads</h3>
        <p data-uuid="95f47696c14243f2a327af55fdb4cc01">Hoping to take away the Union’s advantage at sea, the Confederacy turned to a new type of warship—<dfn title="ironclad">ironclads</dfn>, or ships heavily armored with iron. The British government neglected to stop these ships from being delivered, in violation of its pledge of neutrality. The Confederates had captured a Union steamship, the <i>Merrimack</i>, and turned it into an ironclad, renamed the <i>Virginia</i>. One Union sailor described the innovation as “a huge half-submerged crocodile.” In early March 1862 the ironclad sailed into Hampton Roads, Virginia, an important waterway guarded by Union ships. Before nightfall, the <i>Virginia</i> easily sank two of the Union’s wooden warships, while it received minor damage.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1eaa6d5a5713420fb907a9fb1dd48b14"> The Union navy had already built its own ironclad, the <i>Monitor</i>, designed by Swedish-born engineer John Ericsson. Ericsson’s ship had unusual new features, such as a revolving gun tower. One Confederate soldier called the <i>Monitor</i> “a tin can on a shingle!” Although small, the <i>Monitor</i> carried powerful guns and had thick plating.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f8a75ac0fb0b4995b3c099d791b1b664">When the <i>Virginia</i> returned to Hampton Roads later that month, the <i>Monitor</i> was waiting. After several hours of fighting, neither ship was seriously damaged, but the <i>Monitor</i> forced the <i>Virginia</i> to withdraw. This success saved the Union fleet and continued the blockade. The clash of the ironclads also signaled a revolution in naval warfare. The days of wooden warships powered by wind and sails were drawing to a close.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0f39eac671e441b5a8a0f222c3d46875"> The <i>Monitor</i> sank in North Carolina in the winter of 1862. Scientists located the shipwreck in 1973, and remains of the ship are part of the exhibit at the USS <i>Monitor</i> Center, which opened in 2007.<br />
