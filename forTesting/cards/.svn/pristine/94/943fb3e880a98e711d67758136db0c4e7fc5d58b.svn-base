        <p data-uuid="8b0fd297e15843f28d5f95036af5eac5">Each state handled its economic problems differently. Massachusetts refused to print worthless paper money. It tried to pay its war debts by collecting taxes on land.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9966e5dee8ef4ea7ba33a4fe792adc61">Massachusetts's tax policy hit farmers hard. As landowners, they had to pay the new taxes. However, farmers had trouble paying their debts. The courts began forcing them to sell their property. Some farmers had to serve terms in debtors’ prison; others had to sell their labor.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e826954f9187444bba4869a8089f509e">Many government leaders in the state did not care about the problems of poor farmers, however. In some cases, farmers actually owed these leaders money.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e7b4a44ab94f4c238317fcd9f8774fef">Farmers Rebel</h3>
        <p data-uuid="90f9688b85e74096b37520c3e0da9635"> In August 1786, farmers in three western counties began a revolt. Bands of angry citizens closed down courts in western Massachusetts. Their reasoning was simple—with the courts shut down, no one's property could be taken. In September a poor farmer and Revolutionary War veteran, <b><dfn title="Shays, Daniel">Daniel Shays</dfn></b>, led hundreds of men in a forced shutdown of the Supreme Court in Springfield, Massachusetts. </p>

During their trials, 14 leaders were sentenced to death. However, the state soon freed most of the rebels, including Shays. State officials knew that many citizens of the state agreed with the rebels and their cause.</p>
