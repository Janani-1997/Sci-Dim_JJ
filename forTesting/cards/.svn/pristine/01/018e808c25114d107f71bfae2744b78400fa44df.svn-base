            technologies helped industry grow at a staggering pace. Electrical power
            replaced steam and water power. Factories became larger and produced more and more
            goods. Faster transportation helped move people and goods more cheaply. These
            advances and others fueled the <b><dfn title="Second Industrial Revolution">Second
            Industrial Revolution</dfn></b>, a period of rapid growth in U.S. manufacturing in
            the late 1800s. By the mid-1890s the United States had become the world’s
            industrial leader.&#160;</p>

            Some of the most important advances in technology
            happened in the steel industry. Steel is iron that has been made stronger by
            heat and the addition of other metals. In the mid-1850s Henry Bessemer invented
            the <b><dfn title="Bessemer process">Bessemer process</dfn></b>, a way to
            manufacture steel quickly and cheaply by blasting hot air through melted iron to
            quickly remove impurities. Before, turning several tons of iron ore into steel
            took a day or more. The Bessemer process took only 10 to 20 minutes.&#160;<br />

            Steel</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a051c7b73add40919d0cb8bdf560c861">The Bessemer
            process cut the time and the cost required to produce steel. Factories began to
            make many products out of steel, including barbed wire, nails, and beams for
            buildings. To meet demand for these products, the nation’s steel production
            rose dramatically, from 77,000 tons in 1870 to more than 1 million tons in
            1879.</p>
        <p data-uuid="56cb1200b5904a17aa2326d9e01feaa0">
            Steel made innovative
            construction possible. One of the most remarkable structures was the Brooklyn
            Bridge. Completed in 1883 it spanned 1,595 feet across the East River in New
            York City. Not only was it the longest suspension bridge in the world, it was one of the
            first to use steel cables.&#160;<br />

        <p data-uuid="5bb635e644374f299f25b5ef1141b989">
            Steel was also used for rails to expand the
            railroads. As steel prices dropped, so too did the cost of railroad
            construction. Steel rails that cost $50 a ton in 1877 dropped to $12 a ton in the late 1890s. Companies built thousands of miles of new steel track. The design
            of elegant passenger and sleeping cars improved passenger service.
            Manufacturers and farmers sent products to market faster than ever by rail in
            newly invented refrigerated shipping cars. &#160;<br />

            crossed, such as Chicago, grew rapidly. Railroads also increased western growth
            by offering free tickets to settlers. And as rail travel and shipping
            increased, railroads and related industries began employing more people.&#160;</p>
