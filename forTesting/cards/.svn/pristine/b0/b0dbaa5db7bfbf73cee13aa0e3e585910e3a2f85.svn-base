        <p data-uuid="38909669526e4a55a2a8bd513c9ab9e2">Disagreements between Great Britain and the United States went beyond the neutrality issue. In the West, the British and Native Americans again clashed with American settlers over land.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4f82b6d2159b4f96bf9e9135b1479bb3">The Conflict over Land</h3>
        <p data-uuid="43084204260b49a084b25f66f6f20b4d">In the early 1800s, Native Americans in the old Northwest Territory continued to lose land as thousands of settlers poured into the region. The United States had gained this land in the Treaty of Greenville, but American Indian leaders who had not agreed to the treaty protested the settlers’ arrival. Frustrated American Indian groups considered what to do. In the meantime, Britain saw an opportunity to slow America’s westward growth. British agents from Canada began to arm Native Americans who were living along the western frontier. Rumors of British activity in the old Northwest Territory quickly spread, filling American settlers with fear and anger.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="10a3c690c1f8425bba19c16159971762">Tecumseh Resists U.S. Settlers</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f7fb063e748444748506d03e67ebbc93">Soon an American Indian leader emerged who seemed capable of halting the American settlers. <span><b><dfn title="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</dfn></b></span> (tuh-kuhm-suh), a Shawnee chief, had watched angrily as Native Americans were pushed off their land. A brilliant speaker, he warned other American Indians about the dangers they faced from settlers. He believed that the Native Americans had to do what white Americans had done: unite.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8aebca8137eb4ff1972f71325ba86b01"> Tecumseh hoped to unite the Native Americans of the northwestern frontier, the South, and the eastern Mississippi Valley. He was helped by his brother, a religious leader called “the Prophet.” They founded a village called Prophetstown for their followers near the Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="f429602e9d5b43e9a922d475b1f76e1d">The Battle of Tippecanoe</h3>
        <p data-uuid="79f04a2669d3482aa3f5a69f0074e4c8">The governor of the Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, watched Tecumseh’s activities with alarm. Harrison called him “one of those uncommon geniuses which spring up occasionally to . . . overturn the established order.” The governor was convinced that Tecumseh had British backing. If true, Tecumseh could be a serious threat to American power in the West.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4846c4b71ee14c9cb6d7cb256cc886bb"> In 1810 Tecumseh met face to face with Harrison. The governor urged him to follow the Treaty of Greenville, which had been signed in 1795. Tecumseh replied, “The white people have no right to take the land from the Indians, because the Indians had it first.” No single chief, he insisted, could sell land belonging to all American Indians who used it. In response, Harrison warned Tecumseh not to resist the power of the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3ff1bb7d48ef4a9dbfa5c06fab8d6df7">Tecumseh traveled south to ask the Creek nation to join his forces. In his absence, Harrison attacked. Harrison raised an army and marched his troops close to Prophetstown. Fighting broke out when the Prophet, the spiritual leader of Prophetstown, ordered an attack on Harrison’s camp on November 7, 1811. The conflict escalated into the <span><b><dfn title="Battle of Tippecanoe">Battle of Tippecanoe</dfn></b></span>. <br />

        <p data-uuid="2f78adb223c84237a65a76815be34be6"> The American Indians broke through army lines, but Harrison kept a “calm, cool, and collected” manner, according to one observer. During the all-day battle, Harrison’s soldiers forced the American Indian warriors to retreat and then destroyed Tecumseh’s village. Said Chief Shabbona, “With the smoke of that town and loss of that battle, I lost all hope.” Although Tecumseh was safe, U.S. forces defeated Tecumseh and his followers in the Battle of Tippecanoe. The defeat destroyed Tecumseh’s dream of a great American Indian confederation. He fled to Canada.<br />
