        <p data-uuid="66061e9d7447494690eb53c54ca7eac1">A downside of the technological innovations now
            available to people is cyberbullying. Bullying is harassing a person with
            threats, lies, or embarrassment of some kind. Bullies intentionally try to hurt
            their victims. Cyberbullying is a type of bullying that is done online using
            cell phone text messages and voicemails or computer emails and instant
            messages. Cyberbullies can be people that one has met in person. They can also
            be online acquaintances or even strangers. Most often, cyberbullies know their

        <p data-uuid="0316f4fc62054423a6c76d23e0a8db1d">The best defenses against this growing problem are
            to never give out personal information (such as passwords), to not respond to
            any threatening messages, to not send embarrassing pictures, and to be as
            polite as possible in messages. Police should be notified if there are state or
            local cyberbullying laws that apply. A cyberbullying instance that includes a
            hate crime may break federal civil rights laws.<br />

            understanding connections between genetics and illness. In 2003 scientists

            is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It effectively shuts down
            the body’s immune system. This makes it more likely that people with AIDS will
            contract other illnesses and die. As of 2015 as many as 36 million people

            HIV. But they have not yet found a cure. Public health officials advocate
            abstinence and “safer sex” practices to help prevent the spread of HIV. In 2002
            leaders from around the world founded the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,

            Energy
            consumption in the United States has been increasing along with its population.
            Today, American transportation remains almost completely dependent on
            petroleum. In 2014 Americans consumed about 8.8 million barrels of petroleum in
            the form of gasoline per day. Americans are using more technologies requiring
            electricity in their homes and workplaces. These technologies include air
            conditioning, heating, appliances, and electronics. This has increased the use
            of coal, natural gas, and other energy sources. But while the total energy
            consumption is going up due to increased population, energy use per household
            has declined. This is the result of new, more energy-efficient technologies.</p>
