        <p data-uuid="f96be4a366a44aac83c802ae1bb62ce9">Like many people the world over, Americans expressed their thoughts and feelings in literature and art and sought spiritual comfort in religion and music. Writers and artists were inspired by American history and the American landscape. </p>
        <p data-uuid="6257b24fa1d545f68769ecdd6ecfb001">One of the first American writers to gain international fame was <span><b><dfn title="Irving, Washington">Washington Irving</dfn></b></span>. Born in 1783, he was named after George Washington. Irving’s works often told about American history. Through a humorous form of writing called <i>satire</i>, Irving warned that Americans should learn from the past and be cautious about the future.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1a0c0f7dda8e46beb406d7406aaeffb2"> Irving shared this idea in one of his best-known short stories, “Rip Van Winkle.” This story describes a man who falls asleep during the time of the American Revolution. He wakes up 20 years later to a society he does not recognize. Irving published this and another well-known tale, “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” in an 1819–1820 collection.<br />

His work served as a bridge between European literary traditions and a new type of writer who focused on authentically American characters and society.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f5a6738b26c9477883a0ef7dbe060893">Perhaps the best known of these new writers was <span><b><dfn title="Cooper, James Fenimore">James Fenimore Cooper</dfn></b></span>. Cooper was born to a wealthy New Jersey family in 1789. Stories about the West and the Native Americans who lived on the frontier fascinated him. These subjects became the focus of his best-known works.</p>
        <p data-uuid="788d940a6e004f12b1289bf01c768281"> Cooper’s first book was not very successful, but his next novel, <i>The Spy</i>, was a huge success. Published in 1821, it was an adventure story set during the American Revolution. It appealed to American readers’ patriotism and desire for an exciting, action-filled story.</p>

Cooper’s novels told of settling the western frontier and included historical events. For example, his novel <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> takes place during the French and Indian War. By placing fictional characters in a real historical setting, Cooper popularized a type of writing called <i>historical fiction</i>. </p>

The character was a young white man who had been raised by Delaware Indians but educated by members of the Moravian religious sect. In the books Bumppo worked with various European and native American groups. His nicknames included Hawkeye, Deerslayer, and Pathfinder.&#160;</p>

        <p data-uuid="8b95228078b94d9294a1e2448ed726fb">Some critics said that Cooper’s characters were not interesting. They particularly criticized the women in his stories; one writer labeled them “flat as a prairie.” Other authors of historical fiction, such as Catharine Maria Sedgwick, wrote about interesting heroines. Sedgwick’s characters were inspired by the people of the Berkshire Hills region of Massachusetts, where she lived. Her works include <i>A New-England Tale</i> and <i>Hope Leslie</i>.</p>
