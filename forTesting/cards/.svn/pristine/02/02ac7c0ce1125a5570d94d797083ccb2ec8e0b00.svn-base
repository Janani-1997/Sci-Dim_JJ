        <p data-uuid="b4d03c29e211485abd3da54a36eb661f">Stories of fabulous kingdoms and wealth in Asia captured the imagination of <b><dfn title="Columbus, Christopher">Christopher Columbus</dfn></b>, a sailor from Genoa, Italy. Columbus was convinced that he could reach Asia by sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="20a8c2814ccb407e8dc0a9a69c9b8824">Columbus knew that the Earth was round. In fact, the Earth’s shape was well known among educated Westerners. Columbus’s plans included errors, however. He thought the Earth was much smaller than it is. He also thought that Asia extended farther east and, therefore, that the lands he sought were closer to Europe.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="449532c1039d4cc7aec8570b074cfc5a">The Journey Begins</h3>
        <p data-uuid="5307cfa7d6844ee1955c559830b17989">Columbus asked King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to pay for an expedition across the Atlantic. He promised them great riches, new territory, and Catholic converts. It took Columbus several years to convince the king and queen, but they finally agreed to help finance the journey. Ferdinand and Isabella ordered Columbus to bring back any items of value and to claim for Spain any lands he explored.</p>
        <p data-uuid="af5f799e34fc41dabccd747e59af7490"> On August 3, 1492, Columbus’s three ships set sail. The <i>Ni&#241;a</i> and the <i>Pinta </i>were caravels. Columbus sailed in the larger <i>Santa Mar&#237;a</i>. The ships carried about 90 sailors and a year’s worth of supplies. They made a stop in the Canary Islands, and then on September 6, they resumed their journey. Soon, they passed the limits of Columbus’s maps and sailed into uncharted seas. After more than a month with no sight of land, the crew grew restless.</p>

        <p data-uuid="62240d9a07ef47d5ac200bf96c2fc2db">Soon the crew saw signs of land—birds and floating tree branches. Columbus promised a reward “to him who first sang out that he saw land.” On October 12, 1492, a lookout cried, “Land! Land!” ending the long journey from the Canary Islands.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="266f10d2688149f98da0d3a24d78f5b5"> The ships landed on an island in the Bahamas. Columbus thought he had found a new route to Asia. Instead, he had reached another continent that was unknown to him. Columbus called the island San Salvador, which means “Holy Savior.” Columbus also visited another island he called Hispaniola. There he met a group of native people called the Taino (TY-noh). At that time Europeans called Asia the Indies, so Columbus, believing he was in Asia, called these Native Americans Indians.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="4cfeb1863afc4ae98ae2554d8ec8a085">Impact of Columbus’s Voyages</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d3e2d9e1d90d4e2db01417678c14fc88">The voyages of Columbus changed the way Europeans thought of the world and their place in it. A new era of interaction between Europe and the Americas had begun. Moreover, Columbus’s voyages and the voyages of explorers who came after him would set in motion the development of American society.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8e2ab6fe309643c98d716d53fd02c27d">Columbus’s discovery also created conflict between European countries. Both Spain and Portugal wanted to add these lands to their growing empires. In 1493 Pope Alexander VI, originally from Spain, issued a decree that drew a new boundary for Spain and Portugal. This imaginary <b><dfn title="Line of Demarcation">Line of Demarcation</dfn></b> divided the Atlantic Ocean. Spain could claim all land west of the line.</p>
        <p data-uuid="17cd0833e414449bb6ee9a693c8ba69c">The Portuguese king believed that this arrangement favored Spain. To prevent war, the two leaders signed the <b><dfn title="Treaty of Tordesillas">Treaty of Tordesillas</dfn></b>, which moved the Line of Demarcation 800 miles farther west. This gave Portugal more opportunity to claim lands unexplored by other Europeans.</p>
        <p data-uuid="389d506cbe74479c963799cc1de0366e"> The pope’s decree and the Treaty of Tordesillas helped establish the idea that a country that explored a newly found land was entitled to own and rule it. This idea came to be known as the “Doctrine of Discovery.” By this doctrine, native peoples who had lived on the land for generations were considered occupants, not owners with property rights. The policy would have a devastating effect on Native Americans for centuries to come.</p>
