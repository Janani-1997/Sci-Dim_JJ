        <p data-uuid="77a4ba5025be434281164ddb26b1df3a">Fear of radical ideas and foreigners was part of a larger clash over ideals and values in America. In these social conflicts, differences were growing between older, rural traditions and the beliefs and practices of modern urban society. Americans had very different ideas about what was best for the country’s future.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="f19a9147d4014d43a75833fe6487ba9a">Prohibition</h3>
        <p data-uuid="2013f3a4fd764dcd98458feb6964ece5">An issue that highlighted this conflict was prohibition. The Eighteenth Amendment went into effect in 1920. It outlawed the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. Support for prohibition was strongest in rural areas, while opposition was strongest in cities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4fc2969e34064b6f8a78aa1467fdaf77"> Government officials found it nearly impossible to enforce prohibition. Congress passed the Volstead Act. This act set fines and punishments for disobeying prohibition. Even respectable citizens, however, broke the law. Many people found ways to make alcohol at home using household products. Others bought alcohol at speakeasies, or illegal bars.<br />

        <p data-uuid="d18fd7e9b60a4fe1a0d36d1ef7a55286">Organized criminals called bootleggers quickly seized control of the illegal alcohol business. They made their own alcohol or smuggled it in from Canada or Mexico. Gangsters bribed local police and politicians to avoid arrest. Competition between gangs often led to violent fighting. In Chicago, gangster Al “Scarface” Capone murdered his rivals to gain control of the alcohol trade. By 1927 Capone was earning more than $60 million a year from his illegal businesses.<br />

Faced with a lack of public support and an impossible task of enforcing the ban on alcohol, prohibition was repealed with the Twenty-First Amendment in 1933.</p>

        <p data-uuid="7cf28be46c744bdb87aa6e8255045066">By the end of the decade, the nation was weary of the effects and impact of prohibition. The law had reduced alcohol consumption but had not stopped Americans from drinking. Prohibition had also created new ways for criminals to grow rich. Without government supervision of alcohol production, much of the alcohol consumed in speakeasies was more dangerous than what had been produced before prohibition. Many people came to believe that it would be better to have a legal alcohol trade that the government could monitor. In 1933 state and federal governments responded with the <b><dfn title="Twenty-First Amendment">Twenty-First Amendment</dfn></b>. This amendment ended prohibition. It made the manufacture and sale of alcohol legal again, but laws today still regulate drinking. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 raised the minimum drinking age from 18 to 21 in every state.

        <h3 data-uuid="e290f7865b1b4da8a96bbce95844838c">Religious Ideals</h3>
        <p data-uuid="66bf1e4e1d5a457ea8288773ef7a5b00">Youth culture of the 1920s and prohibition’s failure concerned many religious leaders and religious groups. They saw these changes as movements away from traditional values. This led to a Protestant religious movement known as <b><dfn title="fundamentalism">fundamentalism</dfn></b>. Fundamentalism was characterized by the belief in a literal, or word-for-word, interpretation of the Bible. Popular preachers like Aimee Semple McPherson used the radio and modern marketing tools to draw followers. Fundamentalism was especially strong in rural areas and small towns. In these areas, people often blamed society’s problems on the culture of urban areas.</p>
        <p data-uuid="34ee9e09f5ab4c98a2703febe6f77fc1">Many fundamentalists believed that modern scientific theories conflicted with the teachings of the Bible. This included theories such as Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. Darwin’s theory states that species evolve over time by adapting to their environment. To fundamentalists, this contradicted the biblical account of how the world was made. They opposed the teaching of evolution in public schools. Many cities and states passed laws to prevent the teaching of evolution.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f438d7300f124ce1919ff186a90ed7e3"> In May 1925 a Dayton, Tennessee, high school science teacher named John T. Scopes was put on trial for teaching evolution. This became known as the <b><dfn title="Scopes trial">Scopes trial</dfn></b>. The fact that famous Americans represented each side heightened national interest in the event. Criminal attorney Clarence Darrow led the ACLU defense team. Three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan assisted the prosecution.<br />
