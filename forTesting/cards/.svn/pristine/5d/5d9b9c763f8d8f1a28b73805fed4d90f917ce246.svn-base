        <p data-uuid="9e7d38c4e4974f7993fdf19331183244">Ideas about the simple life and nature also inspired painters and writers in the early and mid-1800s. Some joined the Romantic movement that had begun in Europe. Romanticism involved a great interest in nature, an emphasis on individual expression, and a rejection of many established rules. These painters and writers felt that each person brings a unique view to the world. They believed in using emotion to guide their creative output. Some Romantic artists, like Thomas Cole, painted the American landscape. Their works showed the beauty and wonder of nature in the United States. Their images contrasted with the huge cities and corruption of nature that many Americans saw as typical of Europe.<br />

New England writer <b><dfn title="Hawthorne, Nathaniel">Nathaniel Hawthorne</dfn></b> wrote <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> during that period.

What it was she had no idea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and, meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn’t read, run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training she received at Aunt March’s was just what she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual “Josy-phine!”</p>

The poet <b><dfn title="Poe, Edgar Allan">Edgar Allan Poe</dfn></b>, also a short-story writer, became famous for a haunting poem called “The Raven.” Other gifted American poets included <b><dfn title="Dickinson, Emily">Emily Dickinson</dfn></b>, <b><dfn title="Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</dfn></b>, and <b><dfn title="Whitman, Walt">Walt Whitman</dfn></b>. Most of Dickinson’s short, thoughtful poems were not published until after her death. Longfellow, the best-known poet of the mid-1800s, wrote popular story-poems, like <i>The Song of Hiawatha</i>. Whitman praised American individualism and democracy in his simple, unrhymed poetry. In his poetry collection <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, he wrote, “The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem.”</p>
