        <p data-uuid="424e5995e9be41218224b4b7c6ae7172">Other Americans also began to demand change in laws
            and other discriminating practices during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1974 the
            Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund was founded. Its purpose was to
            build an “informed and active Asian America.” The National Italian American
            Foundation (1975) advocated for Italian Americans. The League of United Latin
            American Citizens was founded much earlier. It played an important activist role
            for Hispanic Americans during this period as well and continues to do so today.
            Native Americans and people with disabilities were also inspired by the civil
            rights movement.<br />

        <p data-uuid="34ae33a08ac24cc2b23e02589c0206ed">One major issue for Native Americans was
            their lack of control over tribal lands. Many worked through the National
            Congress of American Indians (NCAI) to gain more control over reservation lands
            from the federal government. They helped win passage of the Indian Civil Rights
            Act of 1968.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c103ff20c6994139add3ae3fc090e3f3">
            Other
            activists thought that groups like the NCAI worked too slowly. In November 1969
            a group of young Native Americans occupied Alcatraz Island in San Francisco
            Bay. They did this to protest the government’s takeover of Native American lands.<br />

        <p data-uuid="38d19b5e481d49d28d67ee1f0e9d7f77">One of the groups that participated in the
            Alcatraz protest was the <b><dfn title="American Indian Movement">American
            Indian Movement</dfn></b> (AIM). It was founded in 1968 to fight for Native
            Americans’ rights. In February 1973 AIM activists seized a trading post and
            church at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Wounded Knee is the site of the U.S.
            Army’s massacre of Sioux Indians in 1890. Federal marshals surrounded Wounded
            Knee. The standoff ended with a gun battle killing two protesters and wounding
            one federal agent.</p>
        <p data-uuid="10079aaba2f74ea9b4194ac0a0ce31b5">
            Such
            protests brought attention to issues facing Native Americans. In the early
            1970s Congress began passing laws granting Native Americans greater
            self-government on tribal lands.<br />

        <p data-uuid="18a2ded8f69843cf8bd7244c8ec12a2a">During the 1960s Supreme Court decisions brought
            major changes to American society. Under the leadership of Chief Justice <dfn title="4b67d0f8742840bf8109ab7eca12e3fc">Earl&#160;Warren</dfn>, Court rulings
            greatly extended individual rights and freedoms. In <i>Escobedo </i>v. <i>Illinois
            </i>(1964), the justices decided that a person has the right to a lawyer during
            police questioning. In 1966 the Court extended these rights again in the case
            of <i>Miranda </i>v. <i>Arizona</i>. The Court ruled that accused persons must
            be informed of their rights at the time of their arrest. Today police in the
            United States carry cards with the Miranda warnings printed on them. They
            routinely “Mirandize” suspects by “reading them their rights.”<br />

            Court</dfn></b> issued many landmark decisions that further defined individual
            rights. One of these decisions was made in <i>Tinker </i>v. <i>Des</i> <i>Moines
            Independent Community School District </i>(1969). The Court established the
            right of public school students to express political opinions at school. The
            ruling stated that speech protected by the First Amendment includes not only
            spoken words but also “symbolic speech,” or acts that express an opinion.</p>

            In
            this time of activism, some advocates felt that bringing cases before the
            Supreme Court might be a way to gain more rights for the LGBT (lesbian, gay,
            bisexual, and transgender) community. Their attempts, however, were not
            successful. During the 1970s and 1980s, members of the LGBT community began to
            fight openly for civil rights. Direct action groups sprang up throughout the
            country. They called for an end to antigay discrimination. Some people
            condemned this activism but were unable to slow the pace of change. By the
            early 1990s, several states and more than 100 local communities had outlawed
            such discrimination.<br />

        <p data-uuid="7c6733dd9f154c77b868557a1e3ea528">In 1970 Judy Heumann and other activists created <b><dfn title="Disabled in Action">Disabled in Action</dfn></b> (DIA) to make
            people aware of challenges facing people with disabilities. People with
            disabilities often lacked access to both job opportunities and to public
            places. The DIA’s work led to the passage of new laws. The Rehabilitation Act
            of 1973 banned federal agencies from discriminating against people with
            disabilities. The Education of Handicapped Children Act of 1975 required public
            schools to provide a quality education to children with disabilities. In 1990
            the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) outlawed all discrimination against
            people with disabilities.<br />
