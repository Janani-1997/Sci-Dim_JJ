He became involved in local politics early in his life, and by age 29 he was appointed to the U.S. Senate. Throughout his career in the Senate, he was dedicated to preserving the Union. The Missouri Compromise and a later agreement, the Compromise of 1850, helped to ease sectional tensions, at least temporarily.</p>

He developed a plan eventually known as the <span><b><dfn title="American System">American System</dfn></b></span>—a series of measures intended to make the United States economically self-sufficient. The plan had three main measures. It called for a tariff, or tax on imported goods, to protect American manufacturers. The plan also called for a national bank to provide a single currency, making interstate trade easier. Finally, the American System aimed to improve the nation’s transportation system. Better roads and canals would unite northern manufacturers, western farmers, and southern planters.<br />

It ran from Cumberland, Maryland, to Wheeling, a town on the Ohio River in present-day West Virginia. Construction began in 1815. Workers had to cut a 66-foot-wide band, sometimes through forest, to make way for the road. Then they had to use shovels and pickaxes to dig a 12- to 18-inch roadbed, which they filled with crushed stone. All of the work had to be done without the benefit of today’s bulldozers and steamrollers.</p>

By 1850 it reached all the way to Illinois. The National Road and smaller roads allowed people to travel and transport goods more easily, but land transportation remained slow and costly.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4aa76553b5ed434caebb333c73164a9e"> Boats offered faster and cheaper transportation, but geographic features could also be a challenge along water routes. Many rivers had changes in elevation and, in some places, rapids and waterfalls made boat travel impossible. To help solve these problems, Americans built canals, human-made waterways that connected bodies of water.<br />

Construction on the canal began in 1817 and was completed in 1825. It was 40 feet wide, 4 feet deep, and crossed 363 miles of wilderness and hilly terrain. Most of the laborers were American-born, but some were British, German, and Irish immigrants. With the help of hand tools, oxen, horses, and mules, they dug mile after mile through forests, fields, and swampland.<br />

        <p data-uuid="adb783dbbc9e4f5b90625def523e3844">The Erie Canal also functioned as a communication highway. News and ideas travelled the waterway along with people and products. Ideas about women’s rights and the abolition of slavery flourished in canal communities, as did new religious groups such as the Latter-Day Saints, or Mormons. Their ideas spread along the canal. Moreover, settlers bound for western lands brought with them different languages, customs, and religions. At a time of rising nationalist feelings, this flow of ideas helped create a bond between East and West.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="732da42de82c40539763d9611b0158cb">Supreme Court Rulings</h3>
        <p data-uuid="657265c3c6f94ece9063f1a72c7cf7f7">From 1801 until 1835, John Marshall served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Marshall was a firm believer in a strong national government. His Court made two key rulings that reflected nationalist feelings and strengthened the national government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c7f44bd632574b5c8040f49851b8f2b1"> The emphasis on national unity was strengthened by two Supreme Court case decisions that reinforced the power of the federal government. In the 1819 case <i>McCulloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, the Court asserted the implied powers of Congress in allowing for the creation of a national bank. In the 1824 case <i>Gibbons</i> v. <i>Ogden</i>, the Court said that the states could not interfere with the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
