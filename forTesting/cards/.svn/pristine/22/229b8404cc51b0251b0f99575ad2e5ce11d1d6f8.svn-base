A reformer named Lawrence Veiller helped lead the effort to improve conditions in tenements. Describing the effects of tenement living on children, he wrote:</p>

        <p data-uuid="e37c6f1474cb4444858a63b27ac26f65">Veiller worked with an organization called the Charity Organization Society (COS) to get changes made to New York laws. In 1900 he and the COS sponsored an exhibit of photographs and maps graphically showing the conditions of New York tenements. More than 10,000 people visited the exhibit, and they were shocked by what they saw. The work of Veiller and the COS helped pass the 1901 New York State Tenement House Act. This law required new buildings to have better ventilation and running water. It became a model for housing reform in other states.</p>

Like many upper-class women of the era, she received a college education but found few jobs open to her. In 1888, on a visit to England with classmate Ellen Gates Starr, she visited a London settlement house. On their return to the United States, Addams and Starr opened a settlement house in Chicago. They started a kindergarten and a public playground.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4a507ada94144d219ca654818f30f32b">Settlement houses were staffed by professionals and volunteers. Many were educated women who came from wealthy families. In 1886 Charles B. Stover and Stanton Coit established the first settlement house in the United States. It was called Neighborhood Guild and was located on the Lower East Side in New York City. In 1889 <b><dfn title="Addams, Jane">Jane Addams</dfn></b> and Ellen Gates Starr moved into a run-down building in a poor Chicago neighborhood and turned it into <b><dfn title="Hull House">Hull House</dfn></b>, the most famous settlement house of the period.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c62c83e516274d82a1ab2c697c3ad112">The Hull House staff focused on the needs of immigrant families. By 1893 Hull House was serving 2,000 people a week. Some families went through a process of <b><dfn title="assimilation">assimilation</dfn></b>, in which they adopted some American beliefs and aspects of American culture. The Hull House staff helped to assimilate the immigrants by providing English classes, day care, and cooking and sewing classes. Children and adults took part in club meetings, art classes, and plays and learned American sports.</p>

She visited sweatshops and wrote about the problems there. Her work helped convince lawmakers to take action.
