        <p data-uuid="7e801c496a7641df852ad6f2fc09918a"> By 1849 California was home to more than 100,000 people, including Americans and immigrants. Also included in this number were slaves, although a state constitution written in 1849 outlawed slavery. California’s population explosion made it eligible for statehood only two years after being acquired by the United States. In 1850 California became the 31st state.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="18bc9e88aa7e431bb61a00312c373b02">Economic Growth</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b21f55e9b1854472a986fdf4f739a5df">In addition to rapid population growth, a flood of new businesses and industries transformed California’s economy. Gold mining remained an important part of its early economy. But Californians soon discovered other ways to make a living. Farming and ranching became industries for those willing to do the necessary hard labor. The California farming industry quickly took off, with Sacramento as its business center. Soon crops from the state were being shipped to markets around the United States and the world. In addition, lumber mills and factories were established to provide for the needs of miners and city dwellers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f0d2225cd2664ef294c68d23b5f11dc1"> Perhaps the most successful industry during the gold rush, however, was retail trade. Miners wanted to spend their time looking for gold, not growing crops or making products. Instead, they chose to buy the food and supplies they needed from merchants. However, the prices they paid were often very high. California could not supply all the food and materials its new population demanded, and materials had to be imported. Food and lumber were shipped from the eastern United States and from other parts of the world in return for gold. Merchants, in turn, sold these goods for inflated prices. Many successful merchants made huge fortunes in California. Some of them took their money back east to create new companies of their own. Among the entrepreneurs who owed their fortunes to gold rush sales were railroad tycoon Leland Stanford and blue jeans manufacturer Levi Strauss.</p>

        <p data-uuid="346fcf98cf964f0894da8f6fd292d60d">California faced an obstacle to growth, though. The state was isolated from the rest of the country. It was difficult to bring in and ship out goods. The answer to the isolation problem was to bring the railroad all the way to California. Although Californians would have to wait almost 20 years for that, the gold rush did inspire the development of the American railroad industry. Completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 at last gave Californians the means to grow a stronger economy.</p>
