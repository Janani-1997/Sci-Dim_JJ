        <p data-uuid="2b9f5d6987814318bcc286062e7b4e44">In order to persuade the public to support the war effort, President Wilson formed the Committee on Public Information (CPI). The CPI organized rallies and parades. They published posters and pamphlets. Speakers known as “four-minute men” gave short patriotic speeches delivered in movie theaters and churches.</p>
        <p data-uuid="704437c47be44ee08c905f5705e0a87b"> The U.S. government’s war effort also involved limiting some freedoms in the United States. The Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 restricted free speech and allowed the government to arrest opponents of the war. Antiwar mail was prohibited and seized. About 900 opponents of the war were jailed for violating these laws. The Sedition Act was later repealed, but the Espionage Act is still in effect today.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9a774aac6b144366a2a1d59cb964e93a">To prepare the U.S. military, Congress passed the <b><dfn title="Selective Service Act">Selective Service Act</dfn></b> in 1917. The act required men between the ages of 21 and 30 to register to be drafted. Almost 3 million Americans were drafted into service in World War I. A number of the draftees were African Americans. Altogether, about 400,000 African Americans served in the war. Their units were segregated from white forces and were commanded by white officers. Eventually, African Americans were trained as officers. During World War I, however, they were never placed in command of white troops.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6130a0a4df8f4db5bd858fda4272c8fa">Preparations for war were very expensive. Troops had to be trained, supplied, transported, and fed. Ships and airplanes had to be built and fueled. The government raised taxes and issued war bonds. Money from the sale of these <b><dfn title="Liberty bonds">Liberty bonds</dfn></b> provided billions of dollars in loans to the Allies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cbf3b3f872904e2da5421058dbf6193a"> The government took other actions to supply the troops. The War Industries Board (WIB) oversaw the production and distribution of steel, copper, cement, and rubber. The Food Administration worked to increase food supplies and distribution for the troops. It guaranteed farmers high prices for their crops. To conserve food at home, citizens were encouraged to practice “meatless Mondays” and “wheatless Wednesdays.” Many people also grew their own vegetables in “victory gardens” at home.<br />

        <p data-uuid="ab155ab40cfa4637b53d52aece6046c9">Another proposal to conserve food supplies was a prohibition, or ban, on alcoholic beverages. Most alcoholic beverages are made with food crops such as grapes and wheat. Soon after the United States entered the war, Congress granted the president powers to limit the alcohol content of wine and beer so that these crops could be used for food production instead. Some tried to discourage Americans from drinking beer by linking German Americans to the brewing industry. These people hoped that anti-German feelings would lead Americans to stop drinking beer.</p>
        <p data-uuid="11367299d17740f8a0bea141e997cc12"> In addition, the Fuel Administration was established to set production goals and prices for fuels. Its purpose was to make sure that fuel distribution needs for the military could always be met. To encourage fuel conservation, daylight saving time was introduced in March 1918 to extend daylight hours for those who worked long shifts in factories. Fuel conservation was promoted in other ways, such as through publicity campaigns calling for “gasless Sundays.”<br />
