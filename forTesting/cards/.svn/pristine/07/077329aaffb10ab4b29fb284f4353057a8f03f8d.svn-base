Rebels stood next to the cannon with a flag reading “Come and take it.” After a short battle, the rebels drove the Mexican force away, keeping the cannon. Within a few months, the Texas rebels formed an army and captured the key settlements of Goliad and San Antonio. The Texas Revolution, also known as the Texas War for Independence, had begun.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6dc0fed73c344002ae1444dc4cff4d93"> On March 2, 1836, Texans declared their independence from Mexico. The new Republic of Texas was born. Both the declaration and the constitution that shortly followed were modeled after the U.S. documents. The Texas constitution, however, made slavery legal. Delegates to the new Texas government chose politician David Burnet as president and Lorenzo de Zavala as vice president. Another revolutionary, Sam Houston, was named to head the Texas army. Stephen Austin went to the United States to seek money and troops.</p>

            <p data-uuid="a0b362c2b22447e3a890aee54cf23499">Stephen F. Austin is often called the Father of Texas. He founded the first colony of American settlers in Texas when it was still part of Mexico. By 1830 about 20,000 American settlers lived in Texas.</p>
            <p data-uuid="fdba073b58544769a3d8a9625cdba210">Soon, many colonists in Texas wanted the territory to be independent from Mexico. In 1833 Austin traveled to Mexico City to discuss this issue with Mexican leaders. The Mexican government sent Austin to jail for treason, or working against one‘s country.</p>
            <p data-uuid="3fac756136714933b834c62ec44edea5">By the time Austin was released from jail in 1835, the Texas war for independence had begun. He returned to Texas and briefly served as commander of the Texas army. After that, Austin traveled to Washington, DC, to seek help from the United States government.</p>
            <p data-uuid="8133ed39c2ec4bdbad00e66b2e7149f9"> Austin could not convince the United States government to help Texas. However, by the time he returned to Texas in 1836, Texas had won its freedom. Texas was now an independent republic. Austin ran for president of the new country but lost to Sam Houston. In September 1836 Austin became the first secretary of state of the Republic of Texas. He died just three months later.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6e81923bc21f443a9fd954d805a2da9f">The Texans’ actions angered Santa Anna. He began assembling a force of thousands to stop the rebellion. A hastily created army of Texas volunteers had been clashing with Mexican troops for months. Near San Antonio, the Texans occupied and fortified the <b><dfn title="Alamo">Alamo</dfn></b>, a former mission that became an important battle site in the Texas Revolution. Volunteers from the United States, including frontiersman Davy Crockett, joined Texans such as Colonel Jim Bowie in the Alamo’s defense.</p>
        <p data-uuid="53307eb4444c4a63b0211e5004a7c6e7"> The rebels, numbering about 200, hoped for reinforcement from other parts of Texas. For almost two weeks, from February 23 to March 6, 1836, the Texans held out. Colonel William Travis managed to get a message to other Texans through enemy lines:</p>

        <p data-uuid="a44a80f4f040446392f9a66b18fab5bb">Before dawn on March 6, the Mexican army attacked. Despite heavy losses, the army overcame the Texans. All the defenders of the Alamo were killed, though some civilians survived. Following a later battle at Goliad, Santa Anna ordered the execution of 350 prisoners who had surrendered.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c5f7edc871ba49f8ae0af52e82eec5fd">Texans were enraged by the massacres. Mexican leaders hoped that these terrible defeats would convince the Texans to stop fighting. However, the battles had the opposite effect. Outraged by the harsh treatment Texan soldiers had received, the people of Texas vowed to fight on.</p>

        <p data-uuid="0790ab57e05845709b436a1d513a5978">Santa Anna now chased the untrained forces of Sam Houston. Outnumbered, the Texans fled east. Finally, they reorganized at the San Jacinto River, near Galveston Bay. There, the Texans took a stand. Santa Anna was confident of victory, but he was careless in choosing the site for his camp. On the afternoon of April 21, 1836, while Mexican troops were resting, Houston launched a surprise attack. The Texan forces swarmed over the camp, shouting, “Remember the Alamo!” and “Remember Goliad!”</p>
        <p data-uuid="85b36e68361a413fa1722bc461934cdc"> The fighting ended swiftly. In fewer than 20 minutes, Santa Anna’s army was all but destroyed. In this fight now known as the&#160;<b><dfn title="Battle of San Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</dfn></b>, the Texans captured Santa Anna and forced him to sign a treaty giving Texas its independence.</p>

Voters elected Sam Houston as president. Stephen F. Austin became secretary of state but died shortly after his election. </p>
        <p data-uuid="198d748a118545be84b41c0293792da2">To increase its population, Texas offered land grants. American settlers came from nearby southern states, often bringing slaves with them to help grow and harvest cotton.</p>

Some southerners in Congress wanted to annex Texas, but President Andrew Jackson did not pursue the issue. He was concerned that admitting Texas as a slave state would upset the fragile balance of free and slave states. The president also did not want to have a war with Mexico over Texas.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cda0b41383fa40b4995945dbdf65a522">Finally, Jackson did recognize Texas as an independent nation. France did so in 1839. Britain, which wanted to halt U.S. expansion, recognized Texas in 1840.</p>
        <p data-uuid="18d95aa8ad024bb69b3bdc73c3fe07a3"> The Mexican government, however, did not recognize Santa Anna’s forced handover of Texas. For this reason, in 1837 the republic organized the Texas Rangers to guard its long frontier from Mexican and Native American attacks. Finally, in 1844 Texas and Mexico signed an armistice. However, Mexico refused to recognize Texas’s independence.</p>
