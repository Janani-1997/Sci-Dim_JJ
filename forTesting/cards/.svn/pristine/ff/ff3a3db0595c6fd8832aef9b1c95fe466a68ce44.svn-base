        <p data-uuid="2932d4a945024d7aad1a65fab3db56fa">Many Bostonians saw the presence of British troops as a threat by the British government against its critics in Massachusetts. Some colonists agreed with Samuel Adams, who said, “I look upon [British soldiers] as foreign enemies.” The soldiers knew that they were not welcome. Both sides resented each other, and name-calling, arguments, and fights between Bostonians and the soldiers were common.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ed6dffc7b2b64a3f926f97f806291aa9">The tension exploded on March 5, 1770. A lone British soldier standing guard had an argument with a colonist and struck him. A crowd gathered around the soldier, throwing snowballs and shouting insults. Soon a small number of troops arrived. The crowd grew louder and angrier by the moment. Some yelled, “Come on you rascals . . . Fire if you dare!” Suddenly, the soldiers fired into the crowd, instantly killing three men, including African American sailor Crispus Attucks. Attucks is the best-remembered casualty of the incident. Two others died within a few days.</p>

        <p data-uuid="db69e02e26124653b38ea883ed4d6df7">The soldiers and their officer, Thomas Preston, were charged with murder. Two Boston lawyers, Josiah Quincy and John Adams—Samuel Adams’s cousin—agreed to defend the soldiers. The British soldiers claimed that they acted in self-defense. Quincy and Adams argued this point in the trial. The Boston jury agreed, finding Preston and six soldiers not guilty. Two soldiers were convicted of killing people in the crowd by accident. These men were branded on the hand and released. The trial helped calm people down, but many were still angry at the British.</p>
