            invasion, hundreds of thousands of Allied troops landed in France. Led by
            American general Omar Bradley, Allied forces began fighting their way across
            France toward Germany. At the same time, the Soviets were closing in on Germany
            from the east. Although Germany’s defeat seemed certain to the Allies, Hitler
            refused to surrender. </p>
        <p data-uuid="a24842acd23747f38940c6f339a9bafb">In July 1944 Allied tank forces led by
            American general George Patton broke through German lines on the western front.
            While Patton drove forward, more Allied forces invaded southern France. Both
            groups of Allied forces fought their way toward Paris. Encouraged by the
            Allies’ success, the citizens of Paris rebelled against the German-occupying
            forces. By the end of August, General Bradley was leading Allied troops through
            the streets of the freed city. “All Paris surged out to meet the Allied columns
            and welcome their liberators,” remembered one witness. After securing Paris,
            the Allies continued driving through Belgium and Luxembourg, making their way
            toward Germany. Hitler drafted every able-bodied German man from the age of 16
            to 60 and planned one last desperate attack.</p>

            <p data-uuid="0290040e0f7c40bf86e9fa63d631e4ef">The future general grew up in a
                family with a long tradition of military service and knew from childhood that
                he wanted to become a great war hero. His first step toward that goal was to
                attend and graduate from West Point’s United States Military Academy. </p>
            <p data-uuid="536406f8dea74b7bad2580e86e14430c">Patton became an accomplished
                athlete, military fighter, and authority on tanks. He provided his leadership
                abilities in World War I as the head of the United States Tank Corp and trained
                many soldiers to operate tanks.</p>
            <p data-uuid="253104f052a1418bb4897f3f2c2f6f27">During World War II, Patton commanded
                troops that invaded North Africa as well as those that fought in various parts
                of Europe, including the Third Army in France. </p>
            <p data-uuid="03059c968d254ec8b09f1b409d049e21">The general became known for his
                bravery and eagerness to engage in battle, and gruff personality, even gaining
                the nickname “Old Blood and Guts.”</p>
            <p data-uuid="d28f5a5762e34d89bfe1a3c69d715626">Patton’s hard-edged personality
                almost ended his military career. While visiting an army field hospital, he
                slapped a crying soldier who was suffering from shell shock. News of the
                incident spread quickly, and Dwight D. Eisenhower reprimanded him sharply
                before deciding not to relieve him of his duties.</p>

        <p data-uuid="21c68b5babc24c56957c5e682aa054be">Hitler’s goal was for German
            forces to drive through a weak spot in the Allied lines and capture the city of
            Antwerp, Belgium. On December 16 the Germans seized a moment when Allied planes
            were grounded due to bad weather. In heavy snow some 25 German divisions
            attacked the Ardennes (ahr-DEN), a densely forested region defended by just a
            few American divisions. The Germans quickly pushed the Allied forces back about
            65 miles, creating a huge bulge in the Allied lines. This gave the battle its
            name—the <b><dfn title="Battle of the Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</dfn></b>.<br />

        <p data-uuid="3da80c9cac464377b51e0d6d45f3ba31">Allied forces recovered rapidly and stopped
            the German advance. When the skies cleared in late December, Allied planes
            began pounding German troops. In early January 1945 the Germans began to
            retreat. American losses were heavy—between 70,000 and 81,000 casualties.
            Germany’s losses were even greater, and Hitler’s ability to wage offensive war
            was now completely crushed. </p>
        <p data-uuid="9dcc5c23c8954e7daa4bbe2369b4da0f">In the final months of the war, Allied
            bombing raids devastated major German cities such as Berlin and Hamburg. Both
            sides in World War II had used these kinds of bombing raids against the enemy’s
            cities. German raids, for example, killed about 30,000 civilians in the British
            capital of London. In February 1945 Allied bombers attacked the German city of
            Dresden, igniting a firestorm that destroyed the city and killed more than
            35,000 civilians. “Dresden was an inferno,” recalled one U.S. soldier. “I have
            nightmares, even today.” </p>
        <p data-uuid="9da9db8e79834928b73ca1df2dde48d6">As Allied forces surrounded Berlin, Hitler
            retreated to an underground bunker in the heart of the ruined city. On April
            30, as Soviet troops entered Berlin, Hitler committed suicide. A week later,
            the Germans surrendered. The war in Europe had finally come to an end. The
            Allies celebrated May 8, 1945, as V-E (Victory in Europe) Day. </p>
        <p data-uuid="132366a2773a42379eae17c042d2ca1e">President Franklin Roosevelt,
            who had led the United States throughout World War II, did not live to see V-E
            Day. He died of a stroke on April 12. <b><dfn title="Truman, Harry S.">Harry
