            Kennedy was also the first Roman Catholic to become president.<br />

                F. Kennedy was born to a politically powerful and wealthy family in
                Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University, then joined the U.S. Navy.
                He commanded a patrol boat in the South Pacific during World War II and was
                wounded in a sea battle. Kennedy was elected to the House of Representatives at
                the age of 29 and to the Senate six years later. He was elected president in 1960,
                bringing a youthful energy to the White House. He had served for fewer than
                three years when he was assassinated.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3f78303d7f1249cea7332c2ea599deb7">In his inaugural address, Kennedy spoke of
            the opportunities and dangers facing Americans. “Man holds in his mortal hands
            the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life,”
            he said. He encouraged all Americans to support freedom throughout the world.
            He said, “And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for
            you—ask what you can do for your country.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="1ccd9bab04a44e1a9ad2d1cecca7561f">
            As
            president, Kennedy pursued a set of proposals he called the New Frontier. His
            plan included a higher minimum wage and tax cuts to help stimulate economic
            growth. It called for new spending on the military and on the space program,
            and new programs to help poor and unemployed Americans. Kennedy also proposed
            providing greater financial help to public schools. However, political
            conflicts slowed the development of these programs. Fearing a budget imbalance,
            Republicans and conservative southern Democrats blocked much of the legislation
            Kennedy introduced.<br />

                due to his assassination in 1963. However, before his untimely death, he was
                instrumental in the creation of several “new frontier” laws that addressed some
                of his concerns regarding civil rights.</p>

            the civil rights movement. This had helped convince many African Americans to
            vote for him in the election of 1960. As president, however, Kennedy moved
            slowly on civil rights legislation. He was reluctant to anger Republicans and
            conservative southern Democrats in Congress. He needed their support to pass
            other items on his agenda. Kennedy was also busy dealing with foreign policy
            crises.<br />
