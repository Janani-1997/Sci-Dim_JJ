        <p data-uuid="74b2c9a67ed9498eb30ac2a4c1eb54e3">The most serious and deadly event of the Cold War took place in Vietnam, a country in Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese struggled against the domination of China for centuries. By the early 1880s all of Vietnam was conquered by France. The French combined Vietnam with neighboring Laos and Cambodia to create a colony called French Indochina. French leaders imposed harsh taxes and put limits on political freedoms. Vietnamese nationalists began a struggle for independence in the early 1900s.</p>

        <p data-uuid="894786691c3c43d383055c2ee08e31a1"> During World War II, Japan drove the French out of Indochina. Ho Chi Minh did not want Vietnam to be controlled by yet another foreign power. He organized a group called the Vietminh to resist Japanese occupation. When Japan was defeated by the Allies in 1945, Ho declared Vietnamese independence. Using words echoing those of the American Declaration of Independence, he said, “All men are born equal: the Creator has given us inviolable rights, life, liberty, and happiness.” In reality, Ho did not believe in the democratic principles outlined in the American document.</p>

            <p data-uuid="a1f99c40b18a4193a2e0a830c5e4f44e">Ho Chi Minh sought independence for Vietnam for over 50 years. Born to a poor Vietnamese family, he lived in France from 1917 to 1923, where he became a socialist. In 1919 he advocated equal rights for Vietnam at the Paris Peace Conference, but delegates ignored his demands.</p>
            <p data-uuid="b3de4a110fdf468c8d16a661aa57d376"> Over the course of his life, Ho Chi Minh led the Vietnamese independence movement against the French, Japanese, French again, and finally the United States. The war against the U.S. was still raging when he died in 1969, but his name lives on today. After North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975, the name of the South’s capital was changed from Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City.</p>

        <p data-uuid="4901cf5ccedc4cc18c8ef06b00952534">Vietnam was still not free of foreign rule. France insisted that Vietnam was a French colony. French forces moved to regain control of Vietnam, leading to new fighting between the two sides.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d20266e5db13428fa379cdab35b1beea"> Presidents Truman and Eisenhower both supported France with military aid. Military aid is often used by countries as a tool of foreign policy. In this case, American leaders were concerned that a Vietminh victory would lead to the spread of communism in Asia. They feared that if one country became Communist, nearby countries would also fall to communism. This was called the <b><dfn title="domino theory">domino theory</dfn></b>. Americans had already watched Communist victories in China and North Korea. They did not want Vietnam to be next.</p>

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="5c91dabb2d4c46e4b2359da3482e69d2">According to the so-called domino theory, if one country in a region came under the influence of communism, then the surrounding countries would follow in a domino effect. The United States used the domino theory to justify its support of the anti-communist government of South Vietnam.</p>

        <p data-uuid="91fde66b5e2c4072af0fe772e41174ed">The Vietminh had fewer weapons and supplies than the French, but they used hit-and-run guerrilla tactics to gradually weaken French forces. In May 1954 the Vietminh trapped a French army at Dien Bien Phu, where the French surrendered. In July French and Vietnamese leaders worked out an agreement called the Geneva Accords. This compromise temporarily divided Vietnam into North and South. It also called for democratic elections in July 1956 that would unite the two countries under one government.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="fc4d3eb92c59488a995fdcbd6abf412f">North and South Vietnam</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9c248fac39774f5298a23d4d8b7d16e5">North Vietnam became a Communist dictatorship led by Ho Chi Minh. South Vietnam had a Western-style government led by Ngo Dinh Diem (en-GOH DIN de-EM) and supported by the United States. U.S. officials hoped Diem would win control of the country in the 1956 elections.</p>
        <p data-uuid="513faa05ee694dc49977102e61da7b75">Diem, however, quickly proved to be a disappointing leader. He put his own family members in top government positions and used his security forces to imprison and torture his political enemies. President Eisenhower was concerned, but he and his advisers saw Diem as the only realistic alternative to a Communist Vietnam.</p>
        <p data-uuid="316fae964d414cb396b4768fcf197e91">In North Vietnam, meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh introduced land redistribution plans. Like Diem, Ho and the Vietminh violently persecuted their opponents. During the land redistribution process, they imprisoned and killed thousands of landowners.</p>
        <p data-uuid="03830663389046b59976184482c28d23">As the 1956 reunification elections approached, however, a growing number of South Vietnamese supported Ho and the Vietminh. Diem refused to allow South Vietnam to participate in the elections. The United States backed this decision. Diem also arrested thousands of people who supported Ho.</p>
        <p data-uuid="263b5280842b469fa22ab251ad2858eb"> In 1960 members of the North Vietnamese government formed the National Liberation Front (NLF). The NLF recruited South Vietnamese who were opposed to Diem to fight against the South Vietnamese government. The NLF relied on Communist guerrilla forces called the <b><dfn title="Vietcong">Vietcong</dfn></b> as its army, which was supplied and funded by the North Vietnamese.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="64c4eea51f09410ea9009eeeed51dc0a">American Involvement</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d2733af4c56445da98eeb6f06c411267">The United States government felt it had a national interest in stopping the spread of communism. President Eisenhower sent aid, weapons, and military advisers to South Vietnam to aid Diem. Soon after taking office in 1961, President Kennedy sent more advisers and special forces. Although they were not official combat troops, the U.S. military advisers often accompanied the South Vietnamese army on combat missions. Some were killed in action. By late 1963 about 16,000 U.S. military personnel were serving in Vietnam.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6e53be487c834a4f9d08d8da4a18e456">The increased U.S. support did not help Diem, who was becoming less and less popular in South Vietnam. Several attempts were made to overthrow his government, all of which failed. Diem would not hold elections, and his opponents began to consider violence as their only option. He lost more support when he ordered his troops to fire on Buddhist demonstrators.</p>
        <p data-uuid="df4ca861a8584481801b7ad0e6c3bca7"> Some Buddhist monks protested by setting themselves on fire. Horrifying images of these protests helped turn U.S. public opinion against Diem.</p>
