        <p data-uuid="d73a3eb1fff44613b92865ed56191908">Spain’s American empire was not limited to lands taken from the conquered Aztec and Inca empires. Many other Spanish explorers came to North America. They explored the borderlands of New Spain and claimed many new lands for the Spanish crown.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="247104aac3da47889272ddb95d64b32f">Exploring the Southeast</h3>
        <p data-uuid="45fd8bb366bd40378a4ab2a5de392f5e"> In 1508 explorer Juan Ponce de Le&#243;n landed on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. By 1511 he had conquered the island for Spain and founded the city of San Juan. Ponce de Le&#243;n also discovered gold on Puerto Rico. Spanish officials appointed him governor of the colony.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f8b4fa85f91242f083729fe2ec59fb25">In 1513 Ponce de Le&#243;n discovered the coast of present-day Florida. According to legend, Ponce de Le&#243;n heard that a Fountain of Youth, whose waters could make old people young again, could be found in Florida. However, this story did not appear until after his death. Whatever his goal might have been, Ponce de Le&#243;n set out to explore the area. Although he had royal permission to colonize Florida, he did not succeed in doing so.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="bcba8b6fbc5a4bd79dc976096eef17a3"> Two decades later another explorer traveled through Florida. Royal officials gave Hernando de Soto permission to explore the coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1539 his expedition landed in an area near the present-day city of Tampa Bay, Florida. De Soto then led his men north through what is now Georgia and the Carolinas.</p>
        <p data-uuid="aed4adb69720469da9e054af93424810">In 1540, while in present-day Alabama, de Soto encountered the Muscogee peoples. De Soto took the Muscogee chief, Tuscaloosa, hostage as a way to gain supplies. Arguments between the Spaniards and the Muscogee led to a fierce battle. Several thousand Muscogee were killed. Although the Spaniards won the battle, they lost many men and almost all their supplies. Still, de Soto continued his journey, discovering the Mississippi River in 1541. The explorers then traveled west into present-day Oklahoma. De Soto died in 1542 on this journey.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b55f3e62239b4ffeabca4593c414e3f5">The Spanish also explored what is now the southwestern United States. In 1528 explorer &#193;lvar N&#250;&#241;ez Cabeza de Vaca joined conquistador P&#225;nfilo de Narv&#225;ez on an expedition to North America. Their group of 300 men first landed on the Florida coast. They faced many severe problems, including a shortage of food.</p>
        <p data-uuid="479300b1537a4624937b2869394bdb3f"> The group built boats, which made it possible for them to travel around the Florida panhandle. The explorers continued along the Gulf Coast and eventually reached the Mississippi River. Severe weather hit this group hard, and many members of the expedition died. Cabeza de Vaca’s boat shipwrecked on what is now Galveston Island in Texas. Only Cabeza de Vaca and three other men survived. One of the survivors was a Moroccan-born slave named Estevanico. His Spanish slaveholder also survived.<br />

            <p data-uuid="82ca299cfc0c45e99e8c347908aeaa8d">Estevanico was born around 1501 in North Africa. When the Portuguese captured the city where he lived, Estevanico was sold into slavery. As an enslaved person, Estevanico became the personal servant of a Spanish explorer with whom he traveled on an expedition to conquer and settle Florida. The explorer’s ship was blown off course around the area of what is now Tampa Bay, Florida. Eventually, some of the boats wrecked upon the Texas coast near Galveston Island. Only four men survived. Estevanico was one of them.</p>
            <p data-uuid="c73c93eb3f1040c28742b1aaf1c59d03">Each of the four survivors was captured and enslaved by local Native American groups. After six years of captivity, the men finally escaped. They journeyed on foot throughout the North American Southwest, receiving help from Native Americans they met along the way. Estevanico got along well with the native peoples he met. He also became fluent in many languages and was highly regarded for his ability to communicate. In 1536, after turning south, the group reached Spanish settlements in Mexico.<br />
            </p>
            <p data-uuid="2f52d203b0d04df993c85dd687d5d88c">Along their journey, Estevanico and his companions had heard about seven cities that were made out of gold. The men were asked to lead another expedition back into Arizona and New Mexico to find gold. Only Estevanico agreed to the dangerous proposition.<br />
            </p>
            <p data-uuid="b671acca8b1341369675f41ee12b3452">He set out with another group that included explorer Francisco Coronado. Estevanico was sent ahead of the others. In northwest New Mexico, Estevanico was killed in 1539 by Zuni Indians who feared that he had come to kill them.<br />

        <p data-uuid="819bff808c2c4e9a94395153a5956fd0">Cabeza de Vaca eventually returned to Spain, where he called for better treatment of Native Americans. He later wrote about his experiences in the first European book exclusively devoted to North America. Cabeza de Vaca’s book increased Spanish interest in the New World. His writings fueled the rumors that riches could be found in North America.</p>

In 1540 Francisco V&#225;squez de Coronado set out to explore the North American Southwest. He wanted to find the legendary Seven Cities of Gold that were rumored to exist there. His expedition went through present-day New Mexico and Arizona, where a group of his men discovered the Grand Canyon. Coronado trekked through Texas and Oklahoma, going as far north as Kansas before turning around. He never found the fabled cities of gold.<br />
