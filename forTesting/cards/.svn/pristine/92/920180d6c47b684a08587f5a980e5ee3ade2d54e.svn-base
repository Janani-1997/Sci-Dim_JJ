        <p data-uuid="2c2a4d8afccb47b1b15f25baf2a7ef16">The evidence of British support for Tecumseh further inflamed Americans. A Democratic-Republican newspaper declared, “The war on the Wabash [River] is purely BRITISH.” Many Americans felt that Britain had encouraged Tecumseh to attack settlers in the West.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="72c805903e7d4b7aae228df2a84a234f">The War Hawks</h3>
        <p data-uuid="aa423939a0ec4475b93a0e37294ac8b7"> Several young members of Congress—called <b><dfn title="War Hawks">War Hawks</dfn></b> by their opponents—took the lead in calling for war against Britain. These legislators, most of whom were from the South and West, were led by Henry Clay of Kentucky, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, and Felix Grundy of Tennessee. They saw war as the only answer to British insults. “If we submit,” Calhoun warned, “the independence of this nation is lost.” Calls for war grew. Leaders wanted to put a stop to British influence among Native Americans. They also wanted to invade Canada and gain more land for settlement. Others were angered by British trade restrictions that hurt southern planters and western farmers. War Hawks gave emotional speeches urging Americans to stand up to Great Britain.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="9d15e14213034eff96cb7f3844e52ddf">The Opposition</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c287d3e3890444e9adf641d7a6a13ef2">The strongest opponents of the War Hawks were New England Federalists. British trade restrictions and impressment had hurt New England’s economy. People there wanted to renew friendly business ties with Britain instead of fighting another war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f9ffac2877b5464ca5e407ee503ba661"> Other politicians argued that war with Great Britain would be foolish. They feared that the United States was not yet ready to fight powerful Britain. America’s army and navy were small and poorly equipped compared to Britain’s military. In addition, Americans could produce only a fraction of the military supplies Britain could. Senator Obadiah German of New York pleaded with the War Hawks to be patient: “Prior to any declaration of war . . . my plan would be, and my first wish is, to prepare for it—to put the country in complete armor.”<br />

        <p data-uuid="8454bacac50b4394a777c3317473d56a">Republican <dfn title="Madison, James">James Madison</dfn> was elected president in 1808. He faced the difficulty of continuing an unpopular trade war begun by Jefferson. He also felt growing pressure from the War Hawks. By 1812 he decided that Congress must vote on war. Speaking to Congress, Madison blasted Great Britain’s conduct. He asked Congress to decide how the nation should respond. When Congress voted a few days later, the War Hawks won. For the <span>first time in the nation’s brief history, Congress had declared war. Months later, Americans elected Madison to a second term. He would serve as commander in chief during the War of 1812.</span></p>
