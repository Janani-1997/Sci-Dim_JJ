        <p data-uuid="45bdcd42d37d43d0a56a62b3e7fdcb6f">Jefferson wanted to expand the borders of the United States. One problem that the young nation faced was that it had no ports on the Gulf of Mexico. Farmers in western areas had to ship their crops on boats down the Mississippi River to the port of New Orleans. The port of New Orleans was controlled by Spain. In 1801 in a secret treaty, Spain gave the Louisiana Territory back to France. The Louisiana Territory was a huge area to the west of the Mississippi that included New Orleans.</p>
        <p data-uuid="23eea9f596eb4cd697a7604736dcb93f">Jefferson feared that France would close New Orleans to American trade. So he sent James Monroe to Paris to try to purchase New Orleans. The French, however, offered to sell all of the Louisiana Territory to the United States for just $15 million. Monroe quickly agreed. Finalized in 1803, the <b><dfn title="Louisiana Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</dfn></b> more than doubled the size of the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c843e2b4eba34f3a91263fdbe02247f8"> The Louisiana Purchase was a remarkable bargain. However, it raised many questions. The U.S. Constitution made no mention of buying foreign lands. As a strict constructionist, Jefferson was troubled that he might be overstepping his power. However, common sense told him the purchase was a good idea. He and his advisers decided that the right to acquire territory was part of the president’s constitutional power to make treaties. Some Federalists in Congress, however, called the Louisiana Purchase unconstitutional. Yet even Hamilton agreed that the purchase was good for the country. Congress quickly gave its approval.</p>

            <p data-uuid="7cca1b4a7fe7496f8e5d51a62b14521b">Thomas Jefferson was born in Virginia, where he inherited a large estate from his father. At age 26 he began building his elegant lifetime home, Monticello, but he spent much of his life away from home.</p>
            <p data-uuid="ad0eed2f53064f638483959d9b7a714a">Jefferson’s powerful words in the Declaration of Independence have inspired people throughout the world to seek freedom, equality, and self-rule. One of his most celebrated achievements as president (1801–1809) was the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France.</p>
            <p data-uuid="f6f12369dfaf411a9c9d7a1a1eb44b29">Jefferson died at Monticello on July 4, 1826, within hours of the death of President John Adams, his rival and friend. The date was also the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson wanted only three of his accomplishments listed on his tomb: author of the Declaration of American Independence, author of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia. Yet, he had many other accomplishments—governor of Virginia, lawyer, Revolutionary leader, writer, inventor, architect, musician, astronomer, ambassador, secretary of state, and, of course, president of the United States.</p>

        <p data-uuid="53b1448ddd5b42ec8cdb788bcd8fa732">Jefferson wanted Americans to learn more about the lands of the Louisiana Purchase. He asked his secretary, <b><dfn title="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</dfn></b>, to lead an expedition to gather information about the territory. Lewis invited experienced frontiersman <b><dfn title="Clark, William">William Clark</dfn></b> to join him as co-leader. In May 1804 Lewis and Clark led about 30 frontier soldiers from their camp in St. Louis northwest up the Missouri River. By October the group, called the Corps of Discovery, had reached what is now North Dakota. One member of the Corps was York, an enslaved African owned by William Clark. York was a very skilled scout and hunter.</p>
        <p data-uuid="398b626c3c174617b70a6fff271d470b"> A Shoshone Indian woman named <b><dfn title="Sacagawea (sak-uh-juh-WEE-uh)">Sacagawea</dfn></b> (sak-uh-guh-WEE-uh) agreed to guide the expedition when it reached Shoshone land near the Rocky Mountains. In November 1805, after traveling more than 3,000 miles, the Corps of Discovery reached the Pacific Ocean. They finally got back to St. Louis in September 1806. Newspaper reports of their journey and the detailed journals they published made many Americans want to travel west.<br />
