        <p data-uuid="5de2c96c64494e0990256100080f5127">Starting in 1935, new Works Progress Administration projects began to put the country’s painters, sculptors, writers, and actors to work. When he was criticized for hiring artists, WPA director Henry Hopkins said, “They’ve got to eat just like other people.” </p>
        <p data-uuid="2b0e79e9a50e4f86872a129af7e7e220">Some of the work done by WPA artists has become an important part of American culture. For example, WPA musicians went into the nation’s rural areas to record cowboy ballads, folk songs, and African American spirituals. This music might have been lost without these recordings. Artists employed by the WPA made more than 2,500 murals and 17,000 pieces of sculpture for public spaces. WPA writers created a permanent record of American life by interviewing Americans of many different backgrounds about their lives and memories. Today many of the thousands of interviews conducted by WPA writers are available on the Internet. You can read the stories of former slaves, pioneers, Native American leaders, and others in their own words. </p>
        <p data-uuid="3707909a4bdf45a49940f4c1e03afeed">Like many people at the time, author <b><dfn title="Steinbeck, John">John Steinbeck</dfn></b> was deeply affected by the Great Depression. Depression life became a main theme of Steinbeck’s most famous novel, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>. The novel tells the story of the Joads, a family of farmers who are forced to move to California for work. </p>
        <p data-uuid="028078ca6af849dbba9128e8288b4579">Some of the music of the day expressed themes similar to Steinbeck’s. Oklahoma-born folk singer <b><dfn title="Guthrie, Woody">Woody Guthrie</dfn></b> crisscrossed the country singing his songs of loss and struggle. One contained the line, “All along your green valley I’ll work till I die”—a grim reality for some Americans. </p>
        <p data-uuid="2d246f4c565940d88fa3be2c5abdce78">Swing music, meanwhile, became popular for a different reason. Instead of focusing on the sadness of the Depression, swing helped people forget their troubles. Big-band leaders such as Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Count Basie helped make swing wildly popular in the 1930s. People tuned into swing-music shows on inexpensive radios and danced to the fast-paced rhythms. Radios provided people with other forms of entertainment as well. Every week millions of Americans put aside their worries to listen to radio shows such as <i>Little Orphan Annie </i>and <i>The Lone Ranger.</i></p>

            <p class="intro-feature" data-uuid="d80111fd7655471d89404cb5d356299b">Movies in the 1930s provided an escape from hard realities and offered hope that people could still succeed in America. When movie attendance declined during the early years of the Depression, Hollywood responded by cutting production costs and lowering ticket prices. Weekly attendance rebounded in the years that followed<span><span>.</span><br />

        <p data-uuid="cadb8be56e9948a79a3026ec391badf8"> Movies offered Americans another welcome escape from reality. One boy remembered how he and his friends would save their pennies for movie tickets. “[It] was two for a nickel,” he said. “You’d come to the movie in the summer like 8:30 in the mornin’ and you’d see about 200 kids.” For 25 cents or less, adults, too, could forget their troubles as they watched historical dramas, gangster films, comedies, and musicals.<br />
