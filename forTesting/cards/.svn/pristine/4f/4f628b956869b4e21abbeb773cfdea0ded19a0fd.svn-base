        <p data-uuid="2e14dec8a4834ec6822375b205b44cc2">Tired southern soldiers returned home to find that the world they had known before the war was gone. Cities, towns, and farms had been ruined. Because of high food prices and widespread crop failures, many southerners faced starvation. The Confederate money most southerners held was now worthless. Banks failed, and merchants had gone bankrupt because people could not pay their debts.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d795402fec3e48b7a6d3df5a8dcb5a8c"> Former Confederate general Braxton Bragg was one of many southerners who faced economic hardship. He found that “<i>all, all </i>was lost, except my debts.” In South Carolina, Mary Boykin Chesnut wrote in her diary about the isolation she experienced after the war. “We are shut in here. . . . All RR’s [railroads] destroyed—bridges gone. We are cut off from the world.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="100ce111b6a449b1b6fcf54bf94d7af6"> President Abraham Lincoln wanted to reunite the nation as quickly and painlessly as possible. He had proposed a plan for readmitting the southern states even before the war ended. Called the <b><dfn title="Ten Percent Plan">Ten Percent Plan</dfn></b>, it offered southerners amnesty, or official pardon, for all illegal acts supporting the rebellion.<br />

        <p data-uuid="5faf319401bf460fad779f8ee96ebae9">To receive amnesty, southerners had to do two things. They had to swear an oath of loyalty to the United States. They also had to agree that slavery was illegal. Once 10 percent of voters in a state made these pledges, they could form a new government. The state then could be readmitted to the Union.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5198044fe3014b6bb26187bdd3189014">Louisiana quickly elected a new state legislature under the Ten Percent Plan. Other southern states that had been occupied by Union troops soon followed Louisiana back into the United States.</p>

        <p data-uuid="86fcd5bf2d4545559678e6b88d04b125"> Some politicians argued that Congress, not the president, should control the southern states’ return to the Union. They believed that Congress had the power to admit new states. Also, many Republican members of Congress thought the Ten Percent Plan did not go far enough. A senator from Michigan expressed their views.</p>

        <p data-uuid="01198589535b4661964468d099f6634c">Two Republicans—Senator Benjamin Wade and Representative Henry Davis—had an alternative to Lincoln’s plan. Following procedures of the Wade-Davis bill, a state had to meet two conditions before it could rejoin the Union. First, it had to ban slavery. Second, a majority of adult males in the state had to take the loyalty oath.</p>
        <p data-uuid="fd4dfc5e3f8f407e83f2b462ee63ec01"> Under the Wade-Davis bill, only southerners who swore that they had never supported the Confederacy could vote or hold office. In general, the bill was much stricter than the Ten Percent Plan. Its provisions would make it harder for southern states to rejoin the Union quickly. President Lincoln therefore refused to sign the bill into law. He thought that few southern states would agree to meet its requirements. He believed that his plan would help restore order more quickly.</p>
