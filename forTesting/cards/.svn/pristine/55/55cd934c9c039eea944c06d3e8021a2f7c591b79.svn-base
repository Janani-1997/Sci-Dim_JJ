        <p data-uuid="5918be5b27284235a2fda8701eb59696">When Andrew Jackson took office in 1829, he was forced to respond to the growing conflict over tariffs. At the core of the dispute was the question of an individual state’s right to disregard a law that had been passed by the U.S. Congress. This led to growing sectionalism, or sectional differences. </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="12f284b312ef4d0a9101d94a1e848ba1">Nullification Crisis</h3>
        <p data-uuid="98ac759cc8854ff0ab50522cc9884b93">Early in his political career, Vice-President John C. Calhoun had supported the criteria of a strong central government. But in 1828 when Congress passed the Tariff of Abominations, Calhoun joined his fellow southerners in protest. Economic depression and previous tariffs had severely damaged the economy of his home state, South Carolina. It was only beginning to recover in 1828. Some leaders in the state even spoke of leaving, or seceding from, the Union over the issue of tariffs. Calhoun understood the problems of South Carolina’s farmers because he was one himself. But he wanted to find a way to keep South Carolina from leaving the Union. The answer he arrived at was the doctrine of nullification. A state, Calhoun said, had the right to nullify, or reject, a federal law that it considers unconstitutional. </p>
        <p data-uuid="0c654c5044fd42798eabd37ba4c9e2f0">In response to the tariff, Calhoun drafted the <i>South Carolina Exposition</i> <i>and</i> <i>Protest</i>. It said that Congress should not favor one state or region over another. Calhoun used the <i>Protest</i> to advance the <b><dfn title="states’ rights doctrine">states’ rights doctrine</dfn></b>, which said that since the states had formed the national government, state power should be greater than federal power. He believed states had the right to nullify, or reject, any federal law they judged to be unconstitutional. The debate about the importance of states’ rights increased sectional tensions that would further divide the nation.</p>
        <p data-uuid="50ab3de87a0140b3beca57e7b668fc67">Calhoun’s theory was controversial, and it drew some fierce challengers. Many of them were from the northern states that had benefited from increased tariffs. These opponents believed that the American people, not the individual states, made up the Union. Conflict between the supporters and the opponents of nullification deepened. The dispute became known as the <b><dfn title="nullification crisis">nullification crisis</dfn></b>.</p>
        <p data-uuid="27c68300e3aa467d87a6c31a47f3a52c">Although he chose not to put his name on his <i>Exposition</i> <i>and</i> <i>Protest</i>, Calhoun did resign from the vice presidency. He was then elected to the Senate, where he continued his arguments in favor of nullification. Martin Van Buren replaced Calhoun as vice-president when Jackson was reelected president.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="5c2c64371ac749cc854c60ebad1cbc6c">The Hayne-Webster Debate</h3>
        <p data-uuid="436b5b8e61064389b49a6ca317eb269d">The debate about states’ rights began, or originated, early in our nation’s history. This resulted in constitutional issues arising regarding states’ rights. Calhoun was not the first person to propose the doctrine of nullification. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison supported the states’ power to disagree with the federal government in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798–99. Some of the delegates at the Hartford Convention supported states’ rights. But Calhoun’s theory went further. He believed that states could judge whether a law was or was not &#173;constitutional. This put the power of the Supreme Court in question.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cc598f7270d044d4918362febeff665e">The issue of nullification was intensely debated on the floor of the Senate in 1830. Robert Y. Hayne, senator from South Carolina, defended states’ rights. He argued that nullification gave states a way to lawfully protest federal legislation. <b><dfn title="Webster, Daniel">Daniel Webster</dfn></b> of Massachusetts argued that the United States was one nation, not a pact among independent states. He believed that the welfare of the nation should override that of individual states.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="9567dfd44e554eed82020ac3707d886c">Jackson Responds</h3>
        <p data-uuid="23dcc3f5cf9e485a9699d41b8023a2bf">Although deeply opposed to nullification, Jackson was concerned about economic problems in the southern states. In 1832 he urged Congress to pass another tariff that lowered the previous rate. South Carolina thought the slight change was inadequate. The state legislature took a monumental step; it decided to test the doctrine of states’ rights.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8062058f1b044f51a138dd8be582908f">South Carolina’s first action was to pass the Nullification Act, which declared the 1828 and 1832 tariffs “null, void . . . [and not] binding upon this State, its officers or citizens.” South Carolina threatened to withdraw from the Union if federal troops were used to collect duties. The legislature also voted to form its own army. Jackson was enraged.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d4269c52456a4b19933aa1aa5476c91a">The president sternly condemned nullification. Jackson declared that he would enforce the law in South Carolina. At his request, Congress passed the Force Bill, approving use of the army if necessary. In light of Jackson’s determined position, no other state chose to support South Carolina.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ff06f42f7a634334a9600f1983974b6d">Early in 1833 Henry Clay of Kentucky had proposed a compromise that would gradually lower the tariff over several years. As Jackson’s intentions became clear, both the U.S. Congress and South Carolina moved quickly to approve the compromise. The Congress would decrease the tariff, and South Carolina’s leaders would enforce the law.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a8331e43cfd54da0be8896f969134629">The tariff policy prompted sectional differences. Despite the provisions of this compromise, neither side changed its beliefs about states’ rights. The argument continued for years, ending in the huge conflict known as the Civil War.</p>
