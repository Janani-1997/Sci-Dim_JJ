Women found themselves doing work that had traditionally been considered “unladylike.” One female riveter (a person who fastens parts on a machine) recalled her experiences building airplanes:<br />

About 300,000 women served in the armed forces through special divisions such as the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC) and Women’s Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). WASP pilots flew test flights and ferried planes between factories and air bases. Army and navy nurses served in combat areas.<br />

        <p data-uuid="090e335245dc496cbcde78fc767b152c">The Great Migration continued as African Americans moved to northern cities to find factory jobs. In most cases, however, black workers received lower pay than did white workers. They also were restricted in what kinds of jobs they were hired to perform.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4e0652a6e0e74deaa62235d4e32e087c">To protest this unfair treatment, African American labor leader <b><dfn title="Randolph, A. Philip">A. Philip Randolph</dfn></b> began to organize a march to Washington, DC, in 1941. “If freedom and equality are not [granted for] the peoples of color, the war for democracy will not be won,” he argued. Randolph canceled the march, however, after President Roosevelt issued an order prohibiting racial discrimination in the government and in companies producing war goods.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7e8b55b83b8141d7a2317860705b3033"> About 1 million African Americans served in the armed forces during the war, mostly in segregated units. In the Navy, African Americans were assigned only to support positions and denied the right to participate in combat. Despite this, many black soldiers became national heroes during the war. One was Doris “Dorie” Miller, who displayed great courage during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Leaving his post as ship’s cook, Miller manned a machine gun on the deck of the USS <i>West Virginia </i>until he was ordered to abandon the ship because it was sinking.<br />

Many Mexican Americans also found wartime jobs on the West Coast and in the Midwest. Because of a shortage of farm workers, the federal government asked Mexico to provide agricultural workers. The workers, called <i>braceros</i>, were guaranteed a minimum wage, food, shelter, and clean living conditions. About 200,000 Mexicans worked in the <i>bracero </i>program.</p>

Some men wore zoot suits—fancy, loose-fitting outfits with oversized hats. Despite their aiding of the war effort, many faced discrimination. In Los Angeles in June 1943, groups of sailors attacked Mexican Americans wearing zoot suits, beginning the <b><dfn title="zoot-suit riots">zoot-suit riots</dfn></b>. During the ten-day period, white mobs attacked many Mexican Americans.<br />
