        <p data-uuid="4d020c3d591f4a23bfbf45c4b4b0d776">One of England’s main reasons for founding and controlling its American colonies was to earn money from trade. In the late 1600s England, like most western European nations, practiced mercantilism, a system of creating and maintaining wealth through carefully controlled trade. A country gained wealth if it had fewer imports—goods bought from other countries—than exports—goods sold to other countries.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c2d252d8e0c94f80a4a518a883fa10ab">To support this system of mercantilism, between 1650 and 1696 Parliament passed a series of Navigation Acts limiting colonial trade. For example, the Navigation Act of 1660 forbade colonists from trading specific items such as sugar and cotton with any country other than England. The act also required colonists to use English ships to transport goods. Parliament later passed other acts that required all trade goods to pass through English ports, where duties, or import taxes, were added to the items.</p>
        <p data-uuid="fec7ad1e27314ba79acbb4ccd609a9cc">England claimed that the Navigation Acts were good for the colonies. After all, the colonies had a steady market in England for their goods. But not all colonists agreed. Many colonists wanted more freedom to buy or sell goods wherever they could get the best price. Local demand for colonial goods was small compared to foreign demand. </p>
        <p data-uuid="c4d1a47f873e4d07b99e804102be3108">Despite colonial complaints, the trade restrictions continued into the 1700s. Some traders turned to smuggling, or illegal trading. They often smuggled sugar, molasses, and rum into the colonies from non-English islands in the Caribbean. Parliament responded with the Molasses Act of 1733, which placed duties on these items. British officials, however, rarely carried out this law. </p>
        <p data-uuid="4a2a59a87a804511960f0f0a1dead0dd"> By the early 1700s English merchants were trading around the world. Most American merchants traded directly with Great Britain or the West Indies. By importing and exporting goods such as sugar and tobacco, some American merchants became wealthy.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="ac553111f0b44eafaf105ec2dd75b794">Triangular Trade</h3>
        <p data-uuid="77a6ce7d929649788c54b67849600c43"> Trade between the American colonies and Great Britain was not direct. Rather, it generally took the form of <b><dfn title="triangular trade">triangular trade</dfn></b>—a system in which goods and slaves were traded among the Americas, Britain, and Africa. There were several routes of the triangular trade. In one route colonists exchanged goods like beef and flour with plantation owners in the West Indies for sugar, some of which they shipped to Britain. The sugar was then exchanged for manufactured products to be sold in the colonies. Colonial merchants traveled great distances to find the best markets for their goods.</p>

According to his autobiography, Equiano survived the Middle Passage, traveling in a slave ship across the Atlantic. After he arrived in the colonies, a Virginia planter purchased him and again sold him to a British naval officer. While working as a sailor, Equiano eventually earned enough money to purchase his own freedom in 1766. Equiano later settled in England and devoted much of his life to ending slavery.</p>

They told stories and sang songs about their African homelands. By the late 1700s the Christian religion also became a source of strength for many enslaved Africans. Some enslaved Africans resisted slavery. They rebelled by breaking tools, pretending to be sick, or working slowly.<br />
