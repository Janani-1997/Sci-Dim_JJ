        <p data-uuid="555715bf0be243279019f53d17924f6a">By the end of 1967, U.S. military leaders argued that they were nearing victory in Vietnam. General Westmoreland said that he saw “a light at the end of the tunnel.” But events in 1968 weakened the American public’s confidence in this claim.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4b4c970bf0104ec2af5dec62fe062d39">The Tet Offensive</h3>
        <p data-uuid="94c78dc3fec14d0f87c0d786d104ea95">On January 30, 1968, the Vietnamese celebrated their New Year, called Tet. In previous years, a cease-fire had halted fighting on this holiday. In 1968, however, Vietcong and North Vietnamese forces launched the <b><dfn title="Tet Offensive">Tet Offensive</dfn></b>—surprise attacks all over South Vietnam, including an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, South Vietnam’s capital.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b1eae9f3685d4ab5a50934449c5a7862"> South Vietnamese and U.S. forces successfully fought off the enemy strikes. Still, the massive size of the Tet Offensive shocked Americans. They had been told that the war would soon be over. Now they saw that the enemy was still strong and determined. Many began to wonder if government officials were being honest about the war. One poll taken after the Tet Offensive showed that only 33 percent of Americans believed that the United States was winning the war in Vietnam. About 49 percent said that the United States should never have become involved in the war.</p>

        <p data-uuid="06abfb84798f4444a081ad993ca738ee">Gradually, some Americans who had been supporters of the Vietnam War began to call for an end to U.S. involvement. Opponents of the war were called <b><dfn title="doves">doves</dfn></b>—named after the birds that symbolize peace. Many doves believed that the war was draining money that should be spent on social programs at home. Supporters of the war were called <b><dfn title="hawks">hawks</dfn></b>. Hawks called for increased military spending, based on the belief that winning the Cold War took priority over domestic programs.</p>
        <p data-uuid="53db6ef5b3c24b89be554ab3c162da49">The bitter divisions between hawks and doves deepened as the Vietnam War continued. On March 16, 1968, a company of U.S. soldiers under the command of Lieutenant William Calley entered the South Vietnamese village of My Lai. Calley and his men expected to find Vietcong forces in My Lai. Their search-and-destroy mission turned into a massacre when American soldiers opened fire, killing about 500 unarmed villagers, including women and children.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d5fab0045d60464eb5f50f6f822784e0"> At first, U.S. military officials tried to cover up news of the massacre. But former soldiers eventually made details of the events public. Lieutenant Calley was tried by the military and convicted of murder. As with the Tet Offensive, the My Lai massacre caused many Americans to question U.S. involvement in Vietnam.</p>
