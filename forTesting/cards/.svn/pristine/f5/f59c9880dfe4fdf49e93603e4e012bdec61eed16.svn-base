        <p data-uuid="ade9681bd69d4da2b83e73d931165cc1">As president, Richard Nixon promised to work on
            behalf of Americans who opposed protests and supported his plan for ending the
            war. Nixon called these Americans the Silent Majority. He criticized student
            protesters and called on them to stop their activities. He did not believe
            Americans should leave Vietnam quickly.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="eee4e2ca34b94d1daf25f6f96861bd06">New Federalism</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a8a6ec333ac041638b43987c76daa241">Nixon also had a new plan for government.
            Nixon knew that his supporters blamed the federal government for setting high
            taxes and interfering in citizens’ lives. He proposed a plan called the New
            Federalism. The plan would limit the power of the federal government. His
            policies represented a major shift in direction from Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society
            ideas. Under Nixon’s plan, grants of money from the federal government went
            directly to state and local governments, who decided how to spend the money.
            This plan reflected Nixon’s conservatism, or a belief in limiting the
            involvement of government in citizens’ lives.</p>
        <p data-uuid="546904cc381f40b38dcabe735a307583">
            President Nixon promised to reduce welfare spending and to restore law
            and order. He supported policies that gave more power to police and to the
            courts.<br />

            affected the Supreme Court as well. As president, he appointed four new
            justices. Many Court decisions soon began to reflect a more conservative point

        <p data-uuid="2dc2493db4124886ba02b8ba12989094">
            Nixon did not push for new civil rights legislation. He believed that
            the government had done enough in the 1960s, saying, “The laws have caught up
            with our consciences.”<br />

            of so-called <b><dfn title="stagflation">stagflation</dfn></b>—the
            economic condition of combined stagnant economic growth and high inflation.
            From 1967 to 1974, rising prices reduced the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar
            by more than 30 percent. </p>
        <p data-uuid="b667b6536658433f8d3f04872aee0bf2">
            One cause of inflation was the rising cost of oil. By the early 1970s
            the United States was importing about one-third of its oil. Much of this oil
            was purchased from Middle Eastern nations that were members of the <b><dfn title="Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
            Countries</dfn></b>, or OPEC. This group worked to control the production and
            sale of oil to keep prices high.<br />

        <p data-uuid="e3cc913e0a134f1f86db8897405c7cf7">Most OPEC countries were Arab countries that
            had been opposed to the creation of the Jewish state of Israel. On October 6,
            1973, the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. The
            attack started what would become known as the Yom Kippur War. The United States
            sent military supplies to help Israel.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d9f413536981460897a2eff32739aff6">
            Arab members of OPEC responded angrily to support for Israel. They
            declared an embargo, or ban, on oil sales to the United States. The oil embargo
            and soaring oil prices caused an energy crisis. This worsened an already weak
            U.S. economy.<br />
