        <p data-uuid="49a98cc311874a1da5df2fa75c64fa36">The practice of slavery had existed in Africa and in many parts of the world for centuries. Traditionally, slavery in West Africa mostly involved only black Africans, who were both slaveholders and slaves. This changed in the 600s when Arab Muslims, and later Europeans, became slave traders. Though Europeans had long traded resources with Africa, they became more interested in the growing slave trade. </p>
        <p data-uuid="5ffd697fc31c4be4ac22b949eab498df"> In 1510 the Spanish government legalized the sale of slaves in its colonies. The first full cargo ship of Africans arrived in the Americas eight years later. Over the next century, more than a million enslaved Africans were brought to the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World. The Dutch and English also became active in the slave trade.<br />

Most enslaved people had been captured in the interior of Africa, often by Africans who profited from selling slaves to Europeans. The captives were chained around the neck and then marched to the coast. This journey could be as long as 1,000 miles.</p>

        <p data-uuid="7e4ce675fd1141d199f432022868ef74">Colonial leaders across the Americas developed laws that regulated slave treatment and behavior. Slaves were given few rights in the colonies. The law considered enslaved Africans to be property. In some colonies, a slaveholder was not charged with murder if he killed a slave while punishing him. Enslaved Africans, on the other hand, received harsh penalties for minor offenses, such as breaking a tool. Runaways were often tortured and sometimes killed.<br />

        <p data-uuid="a726937a57ef45189a0e405133beab7b"> The treatment of enslaved Africans varied from slaveholder to slaveholder. To protect their investment, some slaveholders provided adequate food, clothing, and shelter for their slaves. However, severe treatment was more common. Whippings, brandings, and even worse, torture, were all part of American slavery.</p>

        <p data-uuid="253ea767833f472385c18b3d74b51f7a">Although they were in bondage, people of African origin found ways to resist their enslavement. They sometimes worked slowly, damaged goods, or deliberately carried out orders the wrong way. </p>
        <p data-uuid="468093a8195248e692e2301803540a24">In South Carolina, the enslaved vastly outnumbered whites, who lived in fear of slave rebellions. Their fears came true in the late 1730s when a revolt occurred in South Carolina. In September 1739 an uprising known as the Stono Rebellion took place. The revolt began when about 20 slaves gathered at the Stono River just southwest of Charles Town. Wielding weapons, they killed whites and marched south, beating drums and chanting “Liberty!” They called out for other slaves to join them in their plan to seek freedom in Spanish-held Florida. Many joined them, and their numbers grew until there were perhaps 100 in open rebellion. Seven plantations were burned along their route and 20 whites were killed. By late that afternoon, however, a white militia had surrounded the escaping slaves. The two sides clashed, and many slaves died in the fighting. Those captured were executed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c38725bb3899465c9f02f402a1c5d359"> Stono and similar revolts led planters to make slave codes even stricter. Slaves were now forbidden from leaving plantations without written permission. The laws also made it illegal for slaves to meet with free blacks. Such laws made the conditions of slavery even more inhumane.<br />
