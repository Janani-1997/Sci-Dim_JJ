        <p data-uuid="0fed898735b14e21ba55530961c5120f">The late 1800s in the United States are often called the Gilded Age. The term came from a novel of that name by Mark Twain. The Gilded Age highlighted the inequality between wealthy business owners, who profited from the Industrial Revolution, and workers, who often labored under terrible conditions for little pay. Many people began to believe that the government should help fix this inequality. The first step was to get rid of corruption in politics.</p>
        <p data-uuid="31a71c80f7c442c3a7010638eb02be0f"> To remind the public that it was their responsibility as citizens to make that happen, Mark Twain wrote:</p>

        <p data-uuid="766e533998a74524adb1cec0c6163c18">In the late 1800s <b><dfn title="political machine">political machines</dfn></b> were powerful organizations of professional politicians that dominated city and county politics. Political machines sorted out some of the biggest urban issues of the time. However, they often resorted to corrupt methods.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f5387899e39e41ad99baa4e7740af8d7">For example, political machines were notorious for election fraud. Not only did they pay people to vote for their candidates, they also stuffed ballot boxes with extra votes for their candidates and bribed vote counters. Some political machines even hired men called “repeaters” to cast several votes in the same election. To avoid being caught, repeaters would change their coats and shave off their beards between votes. Hence the old Chicago saying “Vote early and vote often.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="9c294659ac254aaeaa0e763b8a131aca"> Political machines were run by leaders called bosses, who used their position to gain money and power. The boss would demand bribes and payoffs in exchange for contracts and jobs, as did other machine politicians. They also frequently traded favors for votes. For example, the boss might hand out city jobs to unqualified people in exchange for their political support.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ef9d7de7b29d41f5a8fcb048b05cb167">New York City’s political machine, Tammany Hall, was one of the most notorious political machines. After winning city elections in 1888, members of Tammany Hall rewarded their supporters with about 12,000 jobs. The leader of Tammany Hall was William Marcy Tweed. Along with his greedy friends, “Boss” Tweed stole enormous amounts of money —up to $200 million —from the city.</p>
        <p data-uuid="27f8d23898854a0d8a847811d24a372e"> Despite such corruption, political machines did a number of good things. They built parks, sewers, schools, and roads in many cities. They also provided key social services, such as orphanages and fire brigades. Machine politicians made a special effort to reach out to immigrants and poor families. They helped newcomers find jobs and homes, supplied coal in winter, and provided turkeys for holiday suppers. As one Boston politician said, the role of the machine boss was “to be . . . somebody that any bloke [man] can come to . . . and get help.” In return, many poor families and immigrants gratefully supported political bosses and machines.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3cfa07182a024ae794e11eb42d7cafb2">Corruption was also a problem to the federal government. Many people thought that the corruption extended to the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant. During Grant’s second term, federal officials were jailed for taking bribes from whiskey makers in exchange for allowing them to avoid paying taxes. Another scandal involved members of Congress who had taken bribes to allow the Union Pacific Railway to receive government funds. These scandals and others caused many Americans to question the honesty of national leaders. </p>
        <p data-uuid="6eb04e5fa9b44a1f82b3582bd7c2353e">In response, Americans began calling for changes in the civil service, the government job system. They disliked the spoils system, the practice of giving jobs to the winning candidates’ supporters. Thomas Jefferson was the first to reward supporters with jobs. After his administration, each time a new party took power, it replaced many government officials. Many new employees were unqualified and untrained.</p>
        <p data-uuid="051fa417353c45399aba91ae43248825"> By the late 1800s government corruption was widespread. Reformers demanded that only qualified people be given government jobs. In response, various Gilded Age presidents campaigned for or pushed through many political and social reforms. President Rutherford B. Hayes made minor reforms, such as firing a powerful member of the New York Republican political machine.</p>

But on July 2, 1881, Garfield was attacked and shot twice by a mentally unstable federal job seeker named Charles Guiteau. The president later died from his wounds. Vice-President Chester A. Arthur became president.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9cfa5fdd39ae415d82e0a1429e0dcb54">Arthur continued the push for reforms by backing the Pendleton Civil Service Act, which was passed in 1883. This law set up a merit system for awarding federal jobs. Under the Pendleton Act, more than 10 percent of government job applicants had to pass an exam before they could be hired. It was a start to reforming other government practices.</p>
