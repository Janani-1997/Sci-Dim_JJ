            rights and freedoms—if the states ratified the Constitution.</p>

        <p data-uuid="80e5969c881c43eaba2150d94aa92c82">In
            December 1787, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania voted for ratification.
            In January 1788, Georgia and Connecticut ratified the Constitution, followed by
            Massachusetts in early February. By late June, nine states had voted for
            ratification. The Constitution was officially ratified at this point.</p>
        <p data-uuid="fe731071cfe54de487b486c0699e620a">It
            was vital, however, to get the support of Virginia, the largest state. James
            Madison recommended that Virginia ratify the Constitution, with the addition of
            a bill of rights. After bitter debate, at the end of June, Virginia narrowly
            ratified the Constitution with 89 in favor and 79 opposed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="30baa984962047ebaa70837a7212e905">
            The
            news of Virginia’s vote arrived while the New York convention was in debate.
            Until then, the Antifederalists had outnumbered the Federalists in New York.
            But with Virginia’s ratification, New Yorkers decided to join the Union. New
            York also called for a bill of rights. It would be another year before North
            Carolina ratified the Constitution, followed by Rhode Island in 1790. By then,
            the new Congress had already written a bill of rights and submitted it to the
            states for approval.</p>

            <p data-uuid="01a7107d6c9f41ce8a2cf575fffc23a5">Like several of the founders, James
                Madison was a Virginian. He grew up in the town of Montpelier, and he kept a
                home there for his whole life. Madison is known as the Father of the
                Constitution. A brilliant thinker, he provided many of the basic ideas in the
                Constitution. He argued tirelessly for a strong national government, for
                separate branches of government, and for rights such as freedom of religion. He
                then rallied support for adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
                In 1809 Madison became the fourth president of the United States. As president,
                he led the country through another war with Britain, the War of 1812. He and
                his wife, Dolley, were forced to flee Washington temporarily when the British
                invaded the capital and set fire to the White House.</p>

            Rights</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f7d251a5a199495d979bb69c28d3eb47">Madison won election to the House of Representatives in 1789.
            After he took office, he led the fight in Congress to add a bill of rights to
            the Constitution. In
            September 1789 Congress proposed twelve amendments and sent them to the states
            for ratification. By December 1791 the states had ratified the <b><dfn title="Bill of Rights">Bill of
            Rights</dfn></b>—ten of the proposed
            amendments intended to protect citizens’ rights.</p>
        <p data-uuid="678ef2a74c874ce59ff56eb8e4c9d842">Of these amendments to the Constitution, the first nine guarantee
            basic individual freedoms, including freedom of religion, of speech, and of the
            press. Taken as a whole, the Bill of Rights creates a powerful shield that
            protects people from government abuse.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0893caad13bb4ce8a8d0576fcfecf50a">But the Bill of Rights was more than that. It was the first step
            in making the Constitution a living document, one that can be amended to
            reflect the changes in society. The Constitutional Convention provided for such
            changes. Two-thirds of each house of Congress or two-thirds of the state
            legislatures can propose an amendment. To become law, an amendment then needs
            the approval of three-fourths of the states. By this process, the Bill of
            Rights became the first ten amendments.</p>
