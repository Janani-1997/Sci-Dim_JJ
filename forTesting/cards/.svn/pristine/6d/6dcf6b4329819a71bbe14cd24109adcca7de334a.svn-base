        <p data-uuid="b035fe64a61042b9b71bc804e60aa612">Many enslaved Africans found comfort in their community and culture. They made time for social activity, even after exhausting workdays, in order to relieve the hardship of their lives.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="1dba12d9fe9c4519a5c0b1328c3b601f">Family and Community</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3e2eb08c670b4997b9c27acf1aa8fb32"> Family was the most important <span>aspect</span> of slave communities, and many slaves feared separation more than they feared punishment. Josiah Henson never forgot the day that he and his family were auctioned. His mother begged the slaveholder who bought her to buy Josiah, too. The slaveholder refused, and Henson’s entire family was separated. “I must have been then between five or six years old,” he recalled years later. “I seem to see and hear my poor weeping mother now.”<br />

        <p data-uuid="6beacf986e554a2c8f476fce192396ad">Enslaved parents kept their heritage alive by passing down family histories as well as African customs and traditions. They also told <dfn title="folktale">folktales</dfn>, or traditional stories that often had a moral, to teach lessons about how to survive under slavery. These folktales often included a clever animal character called a trickster. The trickster—which often represented slaves—defeated a stronger animal by outwitting it. Folktales reassured slaves that they could survive by outsmarting more powerful slaveholders.<br />

        <p data-uuid="72f50a43b16f4202bb9455cf1b1e7f51">Religion also played an important part in slave culture. By the early 1800s, many slaves were Christians. They came to see themselves, like the slaves in the Old Testament, as God’s chosen people, much like the Hebrew slaves in ancient Egypt who had faith that they would someday live in freedom.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d2e4f2485c5140bb9b649ac4ff4d7966">Some slaves sang <dfn title="spirituals">spirituals</dfn>, emotional Christian songs that blended African and European music, to express their deeply held religious beliefs. For example, “The Heavenly Road” reflected slaves’ belief in their equality in the eyes of God.</p>

They worshiped in secret, out of sight of slaveholders. Some historians have called slave religion the invisible institution.</p>

        <p data-uuid="387577eeaced4c83b4e8c95ec24a16ce">Maintaining their own religious beliefs and practices was only one way in which enslaved people resisted slaveholders’ attempts to control them completely. In small ways, slaves rebelled against the system daily. Sometimes they worked slower to protest long hours in the fields. Other times they ran away for a few days to avoid an angry slaveholder. Some slaves tried to escape permanently, but most left only for short periods, often to go and visit relatives.<br />

        <p data-uuid="914de6f729484ac3b37b5639d802af02"> Gaining freedom by escaping to the North was hard. If discovered, slaves were captured and sent back to their slaveholders, where they faced certain punishment or death. However, thousands of enslaved people succeeded in escaping.<br />
