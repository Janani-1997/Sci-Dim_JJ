        <p data-uuid="30e1c1587ba94fc68ba42eba58eaea1e">As Jamestown was developing in Virginia, new groups of colonists began planning their move to America. Many English Catholics came to America to escape religious persecution. English Catholics had long been against England’s separation from the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason they were not allowed by the Church of England to worship freely. English leaders also feared that English Catholics would ally with Catholic countries such as France and Spain in conflicts.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="2cc3cd93103f4008989fb5796438b561">Maryland</h3>
        <p data-uuid="eb3f3f60e8d747a583ea3d1c2f8bb580">In the 1620s George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, asked King Charles I for a charter establishing a new colony in America for Catholics. In 1632 Charles issued the charter to Calvert’s son, Cecilius, who took over the planning of the colony. Cecilius, known as the second Lord Baltimore, named the colony Maryland in honor of England’s queen, Henrietta Maria. It was located just north of Virginia in the &#173;Chesapeake Bay area. Calvert intended for the colony to be a refuge for English Catholics. It would also be a proprietary colony. This meant that the colony’s proprietors, or owners, controlled the government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0355fc105d7f48e581ed3c922708a4f2">In 1634 a group of 200 English Catholics came to Maryland. Included in the group were wealthy landowners, servants, craftspeople, and farmers. Settlers in Maryland benefited from the lessons learned by the Jamestown colonists. They spent their time raising corn, cattle, and hogs so that they would have enough to eat. Before long, many colonists also began growing tobacco for profit.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1323b934878948d0a6a9c62e08b59ba4">Although Catholics founded Maryland, a growing number of Protestants began moving there in the 1640s. Soon, religious conflicts arose between Catholics and Protestants in the colony. To reduce tensions, Lord Baltimore presented a bill to the colonial assembly that became known as the <dfn title="Toleration Act of 1649">Toleration Act of 1649</dfn>. This bill made it a crime to restrict the religious rights of Christians. This was the first law supporting religious tolerance passed in the English colonies.</p>
        <p data-uuid="924615a8e90b4f47bc66d237ee194977"> The Toleration Act did not stop all religious conflict. However, it did show that the government wanted to offer some religious freedom and protect the rights of minority groups.</p>

        <p data-uuid="398095e68de34b10a01f55453db0e8e9">Colonies were also established south of Virginia. In 1663 the English king, Charles II, gave much of the land between Virginia and Spanish Florida to eight of his supporters. At first Carolina was a single colony. However, the settlements were far apart, and it was hard to govern them. In 1712 the colony separated into North and South Carolina.</p>
        <p data-uuid="61646b59f2174c3e99e0aeefc2bf902d">Most of the colonists in North Carolina were farmers who had migrated south from Virginia. Among the earliest immigrants who settled North Carolina were the Highland Scots, a group that came from northern Scotland. Colonists primarily from Europe settled South Carolina. Those who paid their own way received large grants of land, and some brought enslaved Africans with them. By 1730 about 20,000 enslaved Africans were living in the colony, compared to some 10,000 white settlers. Both North and South Carolina had rice plantations on which enslaved Africans did much of the work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b13a2c0fdc0540649e4046d45ba3c9cc"> South Carolina’s proprietors managed the colony poorly, and in 1719 the proprietary government was overthrown. The Crown then purchased North and South Carolina in 1729, making them royal colonies. </p>

        <p data-uuid="325c1a960a58423fbcdde413d32268f4">In 1732 King George II granted a charter to James Oglethorpe and other trustees to found Georgia. The king hoped that Georgia would act as a shield or buffer between Britain’s other colonies and Spanish Florida. In 1733 Oglethorpe and 120 colonists, mostly from England, founded the city of Savannah.</p>
        <p data-uuid="888dfa100dd94389a9ace7aeae276062">Oglethorpe wanted the Georgia colony to be a place where debtors, who had been jailed for their unpaid debts in England, could make a new start. He offered settlers a bonus of 50 acres for every debtor they brought along to help with the work on their farms. Oglethorpe hoped that the debtors would better themselves through hard work instead of spending time in prison. Only a few settlers were interested in his offer, however, and his plan failed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="279139385ee74c01ba4f47db6c087eb0"> Oglethorpe did not want Georgia to have large plantations owned by a few wealthy individuals. He wanted many small farmers. To reach this goal, Oglethorpe outlawed slavery and limited the size of land grants. Soon, however, the settlers grew unhappy with Oglethorpe’s strict rules. In 1752 the British government made Georgia a royal colony with new laws. Coastal Georgia was soon filled with large rice plantations worked by thousands of slaves.</p>
