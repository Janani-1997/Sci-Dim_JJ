        <p data-uuid="ccc392361ea443b280392bd618c2c09e" class="">In addition to the issues the nation faced overseas, the Bush administration and later the administration of President Barack Obama confronted a variety of domestic problems. These challenges ranged from unemployment to the national debt.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5a252766e7974022855d17f3a44188fb"> In public opinion polls taken in 2010, Americans listed economic recovery and unemployment among the most important challenges facing the United States. Other major concerns included health insurance reform, terrorism, and immigration. The growing national debt was another key concern. After several years of surpluses, the government began running a deficit again in 2002. Slow economic growth, the cost of the war in Iraq, and tax cuts all contributed to the rising budget imbalance. Beginning with the 2010 budget, the deficit was expected to fall from previous years but remain high as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in a country each year.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b0226d13c06b4a939431bde690c682ed">The American economy has experienced important ups and downs in recent years. During the 1990s the stock market boomed, and unemployment fell to its lowest level in 30 years. Internet companies and other high-tech firms powered much of this economic growth. When some high-tech firms failed to earn profits, their stocks lost value. Many went out of business. Unemployment began rising again. Large investment firms suffered huge losses due to their investments in risky mortgages. Amid controversy, the federal government provided money to help these firms recover.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="2ef0fe2697a1478c9dbb642c39b7abc2">Changes in American Industry</h3>
        <p data-uuid="2ea88bbf80ab4f37a3871fd21ad7d20c">In recent years, many traditional industries have declined in importance to the U.S. economy. Many textile companies, for example, have closed mills. They’ve shifted their operations to countries where labor is less expensive. There has also been an increased use of computer-driven robots to make manufactured goods. This has often eliminated many jobs. This is part of a larger trend in which the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing has steadily fallen. The U.S. economy has moved toward becoming a <b><dfn title="service economy">service economy</dfn></b>. This means that most people have jobs providing services, such as medical care or entertainment, rather than producing goods.</p>
        <p data-uuid="40be63fa15574a848100f9d7d1f38af9"> By the end of the 1990s, about 75 percent of American workers were employed in jobs in the service industry. By 2010 this number had risen to above 80 percent and keeps rising. Health care, computer engineering, and education are expected to be among the fastest-growing fields. Such predictions are based partly on population trends. As the number of older Americans increases, for example, so will the need for nurses and other health-care professionals.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="5246fbc75fd3430e8308b0ab66349604">Globalization and the U.S. Economy</h3>
        <p data-uuid="140e9a1b611e4fe9810c48296d2ddb5a">Another ongoing change in our modern economy is the process of <b><dfn title="globalization">globalization</dfn></b>—growing connections among economies and cultures all over the world. Multinational corporations, or companies that do business in more than one country, play a large part in globalization. For example, you can find American fast-food restaurants in Russia and Japanese car factories in the United States. Increasing international trade has also contributed to globalization. The use of computerized manufacturing processes has sped up and increased productivity. This has improved the standard of living in many countries, providing more international trade opportunities. In 1995 more than 120 nations joined to form the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO’s goal is to promote international trade by removing political and economic trade barriers between nations.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8ee2bc656a1e42fa8cc1831440b546d0">At the start of the twenty-first century, the global economy began to slow down. In 2001 the economies of more than a dozen countries were in recession. Many other countries reported lower growth rates. Foreign investment to developing countries declined, damaging their economies. The U.S. economy also weakened. </p>
        <p data-uuid="1db43ab00c0645af97613bce8a0e84ef"> By 2004 both U.S. and world economies began to recover. However, several major banking firms collapsed and began a global financial crisis in late 2007. Even financially secure banks cut back on their lending. This meant that many businesses could not get the money to invest in new inventory. They could not hire new employees and sometimes had trouble paying their existing workers. The stock market dipped. Unemployment rose quickly. The United States was in an economic recession.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8827dd3e1fbf439a87aa3e51caf0d91f">To pull the country out of the recession, the U.S. government passed legislation intended to boost investment in the public and private sectors. Approved by President Bush in 2008, the Troubled Asset Relief Program committed $475 billion to stabilize the U.S. banking and automobile industries. Later, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This program distributed over $8 billion in funds to individuals through tax credits and programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and unemployment benefits. ARRA also awarded grants and loans for government contracts to American businesses. These actions added jobs, increased GDP, and reduced unemployment in 2009. A slow economic recovery began.</p>
