        <p data-uuid="7295ea970c5143f4afbd408508ba8dd8">The troops that met in the first major battle of the Civil War found that it was no picnic. In July 1861 Lincoln ordered General Irvin McDowell to lead his 35,000-man army from the Union capital, Washington, to the Confederate capital, Richmond. The soldiers were barely trained. McDowell complained that they “stopped every moment to pick black&#173;berries or get water; they would not keep in the ranks.” The first day’s march covered only five miles.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="43539aa9ca0d4dada7bedd34dbcfc0f2">Bull Run/Manassas</h3>
        <p data-uuid="46ad5a1213fa4401b184f0f66485c2cc"> McDowell’s army was headed to Manassas, Virginia, an important railroad junction. If McDowell could seize Manassas, he would control the best route to the Confederate capital. Some 22,000 &#173;Confederate troops under the command of General Pierre G. T. Beauregard were waiting for McDowell and his troops along a creek called Bull Run. For two days, Union troops tried to find a way around the Confederates. During that time, Beauregard requested assistance, and General Joseph E. Johnston headed toward Manassas with another 10,000 Confederate troops. By July 21, 1861, they had all arrived.</p>

They tried to make an orderly retreat back across the creek, but the roads were clogged with the fancy carriages of panicked spectators. The Union army scattered in the chaos.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2b1b37dd06ec49cc83dc2c6898abf502"> The Confederates lacked the strength to push north and capture Washington, DC. But clearly, the rebels had won the day.

        <p data-uuid="d5b80c3a5ed94c65985141d5443c9884">The shock at Bull Run persuaded Lincoln of the need for a better-trained army. He put his hopes in General <b><dfn title="McClellan, George B.">George B. McClellan</dfn></b>. The general assembled a highly disciplined force of 100,000 soldiers called the Army of the Potomac. The careful McClellan spent months training. However, because he overestimated the size of the Confederate army, McClellan hesitated to attack. Lincoln grew impatient. Finally, in the spring of 1862 McClellan launched an effort to capture Richmond, called the “Peninsular Campaign.” Instead of marching south for a direct assault, McClellan slowly brought his force through the peninsula between the James and York rivers. More time slipped away.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1de62e7ba4734ecdb9620e47cc40fe08">The South feared that McClellan would receive reinforcements from Washington. To prevent this, Stonewall Jackson launched an attack toward Washington. Although the attack was pushed back, it prevented the Union from sending reinforcements to McClellan.</p>
        <p data-uuid="373f63b45cb94c519a21ffc1f19e24b4"> In June 1862, with McClellan’s force poised outside Richmond, the Confederate army in Virginia came under the command of General <b><dfn title="Lee, Robert E.">Robert E. Lee</dfn></b>. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Lee had served in the Mexican War and had led federal troops at Harpers Ferry. Lee was willing to take risks and make unpredictable moves to throw Union forces off balance.</p>

            <p data-uuid="5d0f8ff76cfc41de99bb527704197968">Robert E. Lee was born into a wealthy Virginia family and graduated second in his class from West Point, the U.S. military academy. He fought in the Mexican-American War of 1846, helping to capture Veracruz. When the Civil War began, President Lincoln asked Lee to lead the Union army. Although Lee opposed secession, he declined Lincoln’s offer and resigned from the U.S. Army to become a general in the Confederate army.</p>
            <p data-uuid="cf597fe5d057469ab1f47ec4038c881e">As a general, Lee was brilliant, but a lack of supplies from civilian leaders weakened his position. His soldiers—some of whom called him Uncle Robert—almost worshiped him because he insisted on sharing their hardships.</p>
            <p data-uuid="1772cf52f5064445a8daccf93c459463">After the war ended, Lee became president of Washington College in Virginia, now known as Washington and Lee University. Lee swore renewed allegiance to the United States, but Congress accidentally neglected to restore his citizenship. Still, Lee never spoke bitterly of northerners or the Union, and many southerners saw Lee as a war hero.</p>

        <p data-uuid="946326ed1dac4f0c8e72115325f27540">During the summer of 1862, Lee strengthened his positions. On June 26 he launched a series of clashes known as the <b><dfn title="Seven Days’ Battles">Seven Days’ Battles</dfn></b> that forced the Union army to retreat from near Richmond. Confederate general D. H. Hill described one failed attack. “It was not war—it was murder,” he said. Lee saved Richmond and forced McClellan to retreat. A frustrated Lincoln ordered General John Pope to march directly on Richmond. </p>
        <p data-uuid="b58c980862744195ac8a58eff28c4e89">Jackson wanted to defeat Pope’s army before it could join up with McClellan’s larger Army of the Potomac. Jackson’s troops met Pope’s Union forces on the battlefield in August 1862. The three-day battle became known as the <b><dfn title="Second Battle of Bull Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</dfn></b>, or the Second Battle of Manassas.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c2e5e0c3345c4286bfbe7a5948290e74">The first day’s fighting was savage. Captain George Fairfield of the 7th Wisconsin regiment later recalled, “What a slaughter! No one appeared to know the object of the fight, and there we stood for one hour, the men &#173;falling all around.” The fighting ended in a stalemate.</p>
        <p data-uuid="fed6292c15304a0aa8e6c90ab0e477e0">On the second day, Pope found Jackson’s troops along an unfinished railroad grade. Pope hurled his men against the Confederates. But the attacks were pushed back with heavy casualties on both sides.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7c3288f4f9694b9d9ef0d46c80db6a87"> On the third day, the Confederates crushed the Union army’s assault and forced it to retreat in defeat. The Confederates had won a major victory, and General Robert E. Lee decided it was time to take the war to the North.<br />
