More than 4 million of them settled in the United States between 1840 and 1860, most from Europe. More than 3 million of these immigrants arrived from Ireland and Germany. Many of them were fleeing economic troubles in their native countries. Some were seeking political or religious freedom. </p>

        <h3 data-uuid="c84db4dc1a94491c8c36cf677e33e215">Fleeing the Irish Potato Famine</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d98de52fe15a4c0a99b7b6fe13d9908c">Most immigrants from the British Isles during that period were Irish. In the mid-1840s, potato blight, a disease that causes rot in potatoes, left many families in Ireland with little food. More than a million Irish people died of starvation and disease. Even more fled to the United States.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="48bd5e1edb5e4c708628d43798095b5f">Most Irish immigrants were very poor and settled in northeastern cities to look for work. By 1850 the Irish made up one-fifth of the population in seven major cities, including New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. They worked at unskilled jobs in the cities or on building canals and railroads. Irish women often worked as domestic servants for wealthy families, laboring 16 or more hours per day. In 1849 a Boston health committee reported that low wages forced most Irish immigrants to live in poor housing. </p>
        <p data-uuid="e35fc0b9299c4a1a9eede915ebdbad73">Still, many immigrants enjoyed a new feeling of equality. Patrick Dunny wrote home to his family saying, “that cuts a great dash [style] at home . . . think it strange [in the United States] for the humble class of people to get as much respect as themselves.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="71b07436ead546c1a266446c0a2c9fff">Many Germans also came to the United States during this time. In the early 1800s many Germans were attracted by the First Amendment protection of religious freedom and came to the United States to escape religious persecution. In 1848 some Germans had staged a revolution against harsh rule. Some educated Germans fled to the United States to escape persecution caused by their political activities. Most German immigrants, however, were working class, and they came for economic reasons. The United States seemed to offer both greater economic opportunity and more freedom from government control. While most Irish immigrants were Catholics, German immigrant groups included Catholics, Jews, and Protestants.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4371f8fd85c348a78b5ace9ebba733f4"> German immigrants were more likely than the Irish to become farmers and live in rural areas. They moved to midwestern states where more land was available. Unlike the Irish, a high percentage of German immigrants arrived in the United States with money. Despite their funds and skills, German immigrants often had to take low-paying jobs. Many German immigrants worked as tailors, seamstresses, bricklayers, servants, clerks, cabinetmakers, bakers, and food merchants.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4dbb27cdb2574c6aac48a375e942f3ad">Anti-Immigration Movements</h3>
        <p data-uuid="83d43fcfc85a4b79a20d703d481f3c0b">Industrialization and the waves of people from Europe greatly changed the American labor force. While many immigrants went to the Midwest to get farmland, other immigrants filled the need for cheap labor in towns and cities. Industrial jobs in the Northeast attracted many people.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a031f578ea364f6b81d22a4ab7b5395d"> Yet a great many native-born Americans feared losing their jobs to immigrants who might work for lower wages. Some felt implicitly threatened by the new immigrants’ cultures and religions. For example, before Catholic immigrants arrived, most Americans were Protestants. Conflicts between Catholics and Protestants in Europe caused American Protestants to mistrust Catholic immigrants. Some Protestants believed that Catholics threatened democracy. Those Protestants feared that the pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, was plotting to overthrow democracy in America. Those Americans and others who opposed immigration were called <b><dfn title="nativists">nativists</dfn></b>. In cities such as New York and Boston, nativists formed a secret society. Members promised not to vote for Catholics or immigrants running for political office.<br />

Its members wanted to keep Catholics and immigrants out of public office. They also wanted to require immigrants to live in the United States for 21 years before becoming citizens. Know-Nothing politicians had some success getting elected during the 1850s. Later, disagreements over the issue of slavery caused the party to fall apart. Immigrants continued to come to the United States, and the resulting mix of ethnicities and religions continued to influence American society and culture.<br />
