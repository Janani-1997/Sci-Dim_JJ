        <p data-uuid="285c34fb230a403d9b38821a3ae9e06c">Fighting for the rights of African Americans led many female abolitionists to fight for women’s rights. In the mid-1800s these women found that they had to defend their right to speak in public, particularly when a woman addressed both men and women. For example, members of the press, the clergy, and even some male abolitionists criticized the Grimk&#233; sisters. These critics thought that the sisters should not give public speeches. They did not want women to leave their traditional female roles. The Grimk&#233;s protested that women had a moral duty to lead the antislavery movement.</p>

        <p data-uuid="84cc2a4150764b78a2ec2abe861406cb">In 1838 Sarah Grimk&#233; published a pamphlet arguing for equal rights for women. She titled it <i>Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women</i>.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f7e873b60f294b75924d58c20b3bc2df">Sarah Grimk&#233; also argued for equal educational opportunities. She pointed out laws that negatively affected women. In addition, she demanded equal pay for equal work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c77930d2100143d2a7ba9ade8995da42">Sarah Grimk&#233; never married. She explained that the government did not protect the rights of women. The laws of the day gave a husband complete control of his wife’s property. Therefore, she feared that by marrying, she would become more like a slave than a wife. Her sister, Angelina, did marry, but she refused to promise to obey her husband during their marriage ceremony. She married Theodore Weld, an abolitionist. Weld agreed to give up his legal right to control her property after they married. For the Grimk&#233;s, the abolitionist principles and women’s rights principles were identical.</p>
        <p data-uuid="23fb97e3930e4b6db4318d4e67b2e46b">In 1845 the famous transcendentalist Margaret Fuller published <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i>. This book used well-known sayings to explain the role of women in American society. Fuller used democratic and transcendentalist principles to stress the importance of individualism to all people, especially women. The book influenced many leaders of the women’s rights movement. </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a8ab77e184ca42629b66120b3278cea4">Sojourner Truth</h3>
        <p data-uuid="21184ac1def14cbdb9927ac9c5cb89e0">Sojourner Truth was another powerful supporter of both abolition and women’s rights. She had been born into slavery in about 1797. Her birth name was Isabella Baumfree. She took the name Sojourner Truth because she felt that her mission was to be a sojourner, or traveler, and spread the truth. Though she never learned to read or write, she impressed many well-educated people. One person who thought highly of her was the author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Stowe said that she had never spoken “with anyone who had more . . . personal presence than this woman.” Truth stood six feet tall and was a confident speaker. Truth, the Grimk&#233; sisters, and other supporters of the women’s movement were determined to be heard. In 1851 Truth gave a speech that is often quoted to this day.<br />
