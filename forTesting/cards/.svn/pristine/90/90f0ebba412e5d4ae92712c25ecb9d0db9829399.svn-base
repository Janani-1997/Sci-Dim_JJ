By 1900 New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Boston, and Baltimore all had more than half a million residents. More than 35 U.S. cities had populations greater than 100,000. About 40 percent of Americans now lived in urban areas.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f29ef0e222564dab8a1ef5846a59a815">In addition to new immigrants, families from rural areas in the United States also moved to cities, contributing to the growth of urban areas. As farm equipment replaced workers in the countryside, large numbers of rural residents moved to the cities in search of work in manufacturing and related fields. This fundamental shift in the economy had &#173;far-reaching social effects. Previously, most Americans had worked on farms. People worked for themselves, kept the profits they earned, and made much of what they needed. </p>
        <p data-uuid="6d37cd2d7ebc419bab3baabad0fe0e3a"> Americans who worked in factories faced a far different economic situation. They were wage earners. That is, instead of earning income from their own work, they were paid a set amount by business owners. Instead of making the things they needed, they had to buy them—using limited wages—from merchants in the city where they lived.</p>

            <p data-uuid="32866dabd40c42479a40652cebb115c2">At the turn of the century, new types of music began to be heard. Ragtime, a blend of African American songs and European musical forms, was an important new musical style. African American composer Scott Joplin heard ragtime while he traveled through black communities from New Orleans to Chicago. Joplin’s “Maple Leaf Rag,” published in 1899, became a hit in the first decade of the 20th century.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b144861aa3ea4dbe8b001490b713c3e1">African Americans from the rural South also began &#173;moving to northern cities in the 1890s. They hoped to escape discrimination and find better educational and economic opportunities. Cities such as Chicago; Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and New York City saw large increases in their African American populations during the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p>
        <p data-uuid="20152a50ef164a928c84cb6715b8061e">Perhaps the most dramatic example of urban growth was the rise of Chicago. The city’s population exploded from 30,000 in 1850 to 1.7 million in 1900. Chicago passed St. Louis as the biggest city in the Midwest. Along with the large numbers of African Americans moving to the city, many of Chicago’s new residents were immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. By 1900 immigrants and their children made up three-quarters of Chicago’s population.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d29ab3f42d6c499287ccabb06b66115d">Chicago’s location was another factor in its rapid growth. Many of the new railroad lines connecting the East and West coasts ran through Chicago. This put Chicago at the heart of the nation’s trade in lumber, grain, and meat. Thousands of new Chicago residents found work in the city’s huge slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants. Here, meat from the West and Midwest was packed into refrigerated train cars and shipped to growing eastern cities, where it could be sold in shops to customers.<br />
