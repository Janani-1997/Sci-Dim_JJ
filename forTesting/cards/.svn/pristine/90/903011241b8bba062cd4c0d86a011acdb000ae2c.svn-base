        <p data-uuid="41d4a2c8a2404d62a06453f13abde34e">Although Republicans controlled the presidency and Congress, Federalists dominated the federal judiciary. In an effort to continue their control over the judiciary, Federalist legislators passed the Judiciary Act of 1801 shortly before their terms of office ended. This act created 16 new federal judgeships that President Adams filled with Federalists before leaving office. The Republican press referred to these people as midnight judges. They argued that Adams had packed the judiciary with Federalists the night before he left office.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5d9f95c3aa5243c19dcff6743193387e">Some of these appointments were made so late that the documents that authorized them had not been delivered by the time Adams left office. This led to controversy once Jefferson took office. William Marbury, named as a justice of the peace by President Adams, did not receive his documents before Adams left office. When Jefferson took office, Marbury demanded the documents. On Jefferson’s advice, however, the new secretary of state, James Madison, refused to deliver them. Jefferson argued that the appointment of the midnight judges was not valid.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c563e6a7c50f4dbaa1b13dbdce27db55">Marbury brought suit, asking the Supreme Court to order Madison to deliver the appointment papers. Marbury claimed that the Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the Supreme Court the power to do so.</p>

Chief Justice Marshall and President Jefferson disagreed about many political issues. When Marshall agreed to hear Marbury’s case, Jefferson protested. He said that the Federalists “have retired into the judiciary as a stronghold.”</p>

            <p data-uuid="1478fdfe34fe438789ad9091adfd0e36">John Marshall was born, the first of 15 children, in Virginia’s backcountry. He had little formal schooling. He received most of his education from his parents and a minister who lived with the family one year.</p>

The Constitution, Chief Justice Marshall noted, gave the Supreme Court authority to hear only certain types of cases. A request like Marbury’s was not one of them. The law that Marbury’s case depended upon was, therefore, unconstitutional.<br />
