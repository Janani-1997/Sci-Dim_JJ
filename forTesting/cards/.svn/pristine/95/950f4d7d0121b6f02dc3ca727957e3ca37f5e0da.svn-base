        <p data-uuid="f150273940f04b87b4e52c0b48a423bc">By the early 1800s, a distinctive African American culture had emerged in the South. This common culture was based on strong religious convictions, close personal bonds, and music that accompanied almost every part of life. It helped enslaved African Americans to endure the hardships of plantation life.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="89fb9f155cdf4d7d95b00fbd622f2a23">Finding Strength in Religion</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9ddc9c9bd5064abaad221aadf9ad34fd">Religion was a cornerstone of African American culture in the South. By the early 1800s, a large number of slaves practiced Christianity. Some slaveholders tried to use religion to force enslaved people to accept mistreatment. They emphasized such Bible passages as “Servants, obey your masters.” But slaves took their own messages from the Bible. They were particularly inspired by the book of Exodus, which tells of Moses leading the Hebrews out of bondage in Egypt. Many enslaved African Americans believed that this story offered a message of hope for their own people.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a58417c05aac4d768b4e04db2ee1f4d4"> Slaves developed their own form of Christianity, which mixed in features of their traditional African religions. The practice of religion became a way for slaves to resist the power and control that slaveholders wielded over them. So, they worshipped in secret, often at night under the cover of darkness.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d04dcaf5c4d94a75adacdff6482dbc30">Sometimes, spirituals contained coded messages about a planned escape or a plantation owner’s unexpected return. African American spirituals had a strong influence on later developments in American music, such as gospel, blues, and jazz.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="35b057fbce4548c8b65bf55a932734de">An Oral Tradition</h3>
        <p data-uuid="5a567e962def486aadf2482db96e2b79">An important feature of African American culture was <dfn title="oral tradition ">oral tradition</dfn>—the passing on of stories, poems, and songs by word of mouth. In this way enslaved African Americans kept their heritage alive by passing down family histories and African traditions and customs. <dfn title="folktale">Folktales</dfn>, or stories with a moral, also were part of this oral tradition. These tales usually included animals with human characteristics. Most often a smaller animal, such as a rabbit, would defeat a bigger, stronger animal, such as a bear, fox, or wolf, by outwitting it.</p>
        <p data-uuid="51638e2bcc2e46b29163171823bc3398">The rabbit represented slaves. The moral of the folktales was that slaves could survive by outsmarting the slaveholder, who was represented by the more powerful animal. In some tales, however, the bigger animal outsmarted the rabbit. This reflected how slaveholders sometimes lied to and deceived slaves. Such stories served as a warning that slaves should be very careful about trusting slaveholders.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="1696bf00ee9946b0840a586b76874c72">Other Challenges to Slavery</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c99b7edfda1841c3aa51db7dc2f93790"> In small ways, and on a daily basis, slaves resisted the slave system and tried to gain a measure of control over their lives. Some worked slowly or damaged equipment or crops to protest increased hours in the fields. Others ran away for a few days to visit family members or to avoid an angry slaveholder. Sometimes, slaves tried to escape to the North. But this journey to freedom was long and difficult. If they were captured, the punishment was flogging or, sometimes, death. Even so, thousands of enslaved people succeeded in getting to the North.<br />
