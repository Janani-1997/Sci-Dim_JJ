            years were happy and productive for many Americans, not everyone was happy with
            American society in the 1950s. Some women, for instance, were frustrated that
            they could only find work in a limited number of fields such as teaching,
            nursing, or office work. Others were discouraged by the expectation that they
            would give up their jobs when they got married. One woman recalled,</p>

            work. In 1951 J. D. Salinger published <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>. The
            novel’s teenage narrator, Holden Caulfield, criticizes the “phoniness” of the
            adults around him, who he believed loved only money and wanted everyone to be
            the same. In his 1952 novel <i>Invisible Man,</i> Ralph Ellison wrote about how
            African Americans felt left out by American society. “I am an invisible man,”
            Ellison wrote. “I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see
            me.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="ffe4cd88c9cc45e0ba8fd3721712020c">Young people known as beatniks, or <dfn title="beats">beats</dfn>, criticized society with unusual
            writing styles and rebellious behavior. The works of beat poet Allen Ginsberg
            and novelist Jack Kerouac inspired many young people to question the rules of
            mainstream American society. Many young people also identified with rebellious
            characters in popular movies of the 1950s. In the 1953 film <i>The Wild One,</i>
            actor Marlon Brando plays Johnny, a wild biker who challenges the rules of
            society. When asked, “Hey Johnny, what are you rebelling against?” Johnny
            replies, “Whadda ya got?”</p>
