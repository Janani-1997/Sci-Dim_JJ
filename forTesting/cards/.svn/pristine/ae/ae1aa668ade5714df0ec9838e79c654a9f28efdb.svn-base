        <p data-uuid="f8906db1a3814aae8b573451cf815196">Despite many plans for educational and economic reform, President Bush was soon faced with the challenge of confronting terrorism. His administration became focused on developing a foreign policy to protect Americans from the growing threat of terrorist attacks after the events of September 11, 2001.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="6a0718b93a444000a3a253afa74f8533">September 11, 2001</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f71d3854f3b04d758d834766cb15f492">On September 11, 2001, terrorists took control of four commercial airliners. The hijackers used them as weapons to attack sites in Washington, DC, and New York City. They flew an airplane into each of the two towers of the <b><dfn title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</dfn></b>, an important business center in New York City. The resulting fires caused the buildings, which at the time of their construction in 1973 had been the tallest in the nation, to crumble to the ground with many people inside. Another airplane was flown into the <b><dfn title="Pentagon">Pentagon</dfn></b>, the headquarters of the Department of Defense located outside of Washington, DC. A fourth airplane crashed in a Pennsylvania field. About 3,000 people were killed in the attacks. These included the airplane passengers, workers and visitors in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and rescue workers aiding the victims.</p>

At the same time, recognition of the bravery of those who responded to the disaster gave people comfort and strength. The heroism of New York’s rescue workers struck awe in people throughout the nation and the world. Several hundred firefighters and police officers had run willingly into the burning towers, only to perish when they collapsed.</p>

Telephone calls from passengers aboard the plane indicated they knew about the other attacks and had decided to stop the terrorists on board from hitting their next target.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f8f625a4cc334b18b14541d79bc5ae74"> Inspired by these stories, Americans reached out to the victims of 9/11. Blood collection centers received two-and-a-half times the normal donations in the days after 9/11. Millions of dollars poured into charities. Rescue workers from around the country traveled to New York to help with the recovery efforts at Ground Zero, the site where the Twin Towers had stood.</p>

        <p data-uuid="a4c2fd419ed44f15a2904f7e3aa67dda">Determined to find and punish those responsible for the attacks, United States officials determined that the hijackers were members of a fundamentalist Islamic terrorist group in Afghanistan called <b><dfn title="al Qaeda">al Qaeda</dfn></b>, or “the Base.” The group was based in Afghanistan and was led by a wealthy Saudi Arabian exile, <b><dfn title="bin Laden, Osama">Osama bin Laden</dfn></b>. The Taliban was an extreme Islamic group that ruled the country. After Taliban leaders refused to turn over bin Laden, the United States took military action. In October 2001 the United States attacked Afghanistan. It drove the Taliban from power but failed to find and capture bin Laden. The United States then began helping Afghanistan to rebuild and establish a democratic government. </p>

        <p data-uuid="f4013437052f4004af9838045ed78bf4">After the attack on Afghanistan, attention turned to Iraq. President Bush argued that Saddam Hussein, the dictator of Iraq, posed an immediate threat to U.S. security. When the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991, Saddam had agreed to give up Iraq’s <b><dfn title="weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</dfn></b>. These are chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons that can kill thousands. However, Saddam failed to fully cooperate with UN weapons inspectors.</p>

        <p data-uuid="492bcb9e40de4903ad26e8a5702c1d98">Leaders from France, Germany, and Russia argued that the UN inspectors should be given more time to search for weapons. President Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair disagreed. They said Iraq should be forced to comply with the weapons ban. On March 20, 2003, the United States and a coalition of allies launched a ground attack on Iraq. Saddam’s government collapsed, and Saddam was eventually captured.</p>

U.S. soldiers and Iraqis who were working to rebuild the country were attacked. Iraqi voters elected new government leaders and approved a new constitution in 2005. In 2006 an Iraqi court sentenced Saddam to death. He was executed a short time later. Deep divisions among Iraqis remained an issue, however, threatening the stability of the new government.</p>
