            up the Oregon Trail. At the Snake River in present-day Idaho, the trail split.
            People bound for California took the southern route, which became known as the
            California Trail. This path ran through the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
            American emigrants and traders on the California Trail tried to cross these
            mountains before the season’s first snows.</p>

            Americans traveled along the California Trail, few actually settled in
            California. American merchants were usually more interested in trading goods
            made in factories than in establishing settlements. They traded for gold and
            silver coins, hides, and tallow (animal fat used to make soap and candles) from
            Mexico. California became a meeting ground for traders from Mexico and the
            United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9544ae4395d443e5af069b630ce5a3b4">Before the
            Mexican-American War, California’s population consisted mostly of Mexicans and
            Native Americans. When Mexico controlled California, Mexican officials did not
            want many Americans to settle there. However, in 1839 they did give Swiss
            immigrant <b><dfn title="Sutter, John">John Sutter</dfn></b> permission to start a colony. Sutter’s Fort,
            located near the Sacramento River, soon became a popular rest stop for many
            American emigrants. These new arrivals praised Sutter’s hospitality and helpfulness.
            By the mid-1840s some Anglo Californians were publishing newspaper
            advertisements and guidebooks encouraging other settlers to move to the West.<br />

        <p data-uuid="542c1dbcad6346058ab642fa6a6543d5">In January 1848 Sutter sent a carpenter named
            James Marshall to build a sawmill beside a nearby river. While working near Sutter’s
            Mill, Marshall glanced at the ground. “My eye was caught by a glimpse of
            something shining. . . . I reached my hand down and picked it up; it made my
            heart thump, for I was certain it was gold.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="3848fa7f7f384f61b0ee0162957d8e29">Sutter and Marshall agreed to keep the
            discovery a secret. However, when they examined the work site the next day,
            they met a Spanish-speaking Native American worker holding a nugget and
            shouting, “Oro [gold]! Oro! Oro!” </p>

            gold. Stories of the discovery rapidly spread across the country. President
            Polk added to the national excitement by confirming the California gold strike
            in his farewell message to Congress in December 1848. In 1849 about 80,000
            gold-seekers came to California, hoping to strike it rich. These gold-seeking
            migrants to California were called <b><dfn title="forty-niner">forty-niners</dfn></b>.
            As one Iowa woman who left to find gold recalled, “At that time the ‘gold
            fever’ was contagious, and few, old or young, escaped the malady [sickness].”
            Nearly 80 percent of the forty-niners were Americans, while the rest came from
            all over the world. </p>

            via sea routes. Midwestern gold-seekers usually traveled west in wagon trains.

            Few of the forty-niners had any previous
            gold-mining experience. The work was difficult and time-consuming. The
            forty-niners would <b><dfn title="prospect">prospect</dfn></b>, or
            search for gold, along the banks of streams or in shallow surface mines. The
            early forty-niners worked an area that ran for 70 miles along rivers in
            northern California.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="7ff797be53e7407eb685839aa196302c">The first person to arrive at a site would
            “stake a claim.” Early miners frequently banded together to prospect for gold.
            The miners agreed that each would keep a share of whatever gold was discovered.
            When one group abandoned a claim, more recent arrivals often took it over,
            hoping for success. Sometimes two or more groups arrived in an area at the same
            time. In the early gold-rush days, before courts were established, this competition
            often led to conflict. Occasionally, violent disputes arose over competing
            claims.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5dfce2a159154cf0a65d486449c541ca">Mining methods varied according to the
            location. The most popular method, placer (PLA-suhr) mining, was done along
            rivers and streams. <b><dfn title="placer miner">Placer miners</dfn></b>
            used pans or other devices to wash gold nuggets out of loose rock and gravel.
            To reach gold deposits buried in the hills, miners had to dig shafts and
            tunnels. These tasks were usually pursued by mining companies, rather than by
            individuals.</p>

            peaked at more than $60 million. Individual success stories inspired many
            miners. One lucky man found two and a half pounds of gold after only 15 minutes
            of work. Two African American miners found a rich gold deposit that became known
            as Negro Hill in honor of their discovery. The vast majority of miners, however,
            did not become rich. Forty-niner Alonzo Delano commented that the “lean, meager
            [thin], worn-out and woebegone [sorrowful] miner . . . might daily be seen at

            gathered to look for gold. These camps had colorful names, such as Hangtown or
            Poker Flat. The mining camps usually began as a row of tents along the streams
            flowing out of the Sierra Nevada. In time the tents gave way to rough wooden
            houses, stores, and saloons.&#160;</p>

        <p data-uuid="9b2d58c604fb4f09be59032dedd0a342">Miners in the camps came from many cultures
            and backgrounds. Most miners were young, unmarried men in search of adventure.
            Only around 5 percent of gold-rush immigrants were women or children. The
            hardworking women generally made good money by cooking meals, washing clothes, and
            operating boardinghouses. One such woman, Catherine Haun, recalled her first
            home in California—a wooden shed that was built in a day.&#160;The building next door was a saloon. However,
            she quite liked her new home and neighbors.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8bb1f55eccb44d5eba27034c464ee5ab">
            Some settlers took full advantage of these
            conditions for free enterprise. For example, Haun’s husband was a lawyer. He
            concluded that he could make more money practicing law than he could panning
            for gold. He was one of many people who made a good living supplying miners with
            food, clothing, equipment, and other services. Miners paid high prices for
            basic necessities because the large amounts of gold in circulation caused
            severe inflation in California. A loaf of bread, for example, might cost 5
            cents in the East but would sell for 50 to 75 cents in San Francisco. Eggs
            sometimes sold for $1 apiece.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="3b6db570da6846f5be0729561a58903c">Immigrants
            to California</h3>
        <p data-uuid="af6d1e5d0d9543fc80ce1dcbb2aeda44">The lure of gold in California attracted
            miners from around the world. Many were from countries that had seen few immigrants
            to the United States in the past. They were drawn to California by the lure of
            wealth. For example, famine and economic hardship in southeastern China caused
            many Chinese men to leave China for America.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e801dc8cc9e0457c8c05e9f03a5c15ff">Most hoped to find great wealth and then
            return home to China. These immigrants were known in Chinese as <i>gam saan haak</i>, or “travelers to Gold Mountain.”
            Between 1849 and 1853, about 24,000 Chinese men moved to California. “From far
            and near we came and were pleased,” wrote merchant Lai Chun-chuen in 1855.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f8e47ec77db9444e8fb36dab523b7a16">Chinese immigrants soon discovered that many
            Americans did not welcome them, however. In 1852 California placed a tax of $20
            a month on all foreign miners. This was more than many of the Chinese miners
            could afford. However, they had no choice but to find a way to pay this tax if
            they wanted to prospect for gold. Some Chinese workers were the targets of violent
            attacks. If the Chinese miners dared to protest the attacks, the legal system
            favored Americans over immigrants.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e34e535eca064d52b7b9849fc1666869">Despite such treatment, many Chinese&#160;immigrants still worked in the gold mines. Some looked for other jobs. Others
            opened their own businesses. A newspaper reported Chinese working as
            “ploughmen, laundry-men, placer miners, woolen spinners and weavers, domestic servants,
            cigar makers, [and] shoemakers.” So many Chinese owned businesses in San
            Francisco that their neighborhood became known as Chinatown, as it still is
            today.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d7e8e77f3748467c9ba28fc9e91c633a">
            In 1849 alone, about 20,000 immigrants arrived
            in California not only from China but also from Europe, Mexico, and South
            America. Like most Americans who sought gold, these new arrivals intended to
            return home after they had made their fortunes. However, many decided to stay.
            Some began businesses. For example, Levi Strauss, a German immigrant, earned a
            fortune by making tough denim pants for miners.</p>
