            <p data-uuid="2455796df4a4432e9bd7441df293ec9f">When
                Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968, the Cold War had been underway for
                two decades. It would continue for over two more. Over those decades,
                five presidents—Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush—had to watch carefully, defend against, and negotiate with the Soviet Union. Each president
                aimed to keep the United States safe. Each also faced unique circumstances and had his own ideas about how best to advance U.S. interests. President Nixon negotiated a d&#233;tente with and participated in the first Strategic Arms
                Limitation Talks with the Soviet Union. After the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, Carter changed tactics, ending arms-control talks and refusing to participate in the 1980 Summer Olympics in
                Moscow. Reagan took a tough stance against the Soviet Union and expanded the
                U.S. military, but was willing to negotiate when new Soviet leadership, Mikhail
                Gorbachev, took over. President George H. W. Bush helped bring the Cold War to an
                end.</p>

            <p data-uuid="0d8f177ad93d4da2aea8974eea0d9ddb">The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated U.S. foreign policy and many of the decisions made by U.S. presidents throughout the second half of the 20th century. Write an analytical essay about the changing nature of the U.S.-USSR relationship over time using the speeches given by different presidents.</p>
