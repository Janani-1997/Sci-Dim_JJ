        <p data-uuid="fa070d61b89748739c460795ba9bb0df">In 1802 just before handing over Louisiana to France, Spain closed New Orleans to American shipping. Angry farmers worried about what this would do to the economy. President Jefferson asked the U.S. ambassador to France, Robert R. Livingston, to try to buy New Orleans. Jefferson sent James Monroe to help Livingston.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="09eb47e7c2a840b48ca18a3ef63c5b73">France was led by Napol&#233;on (nuh-POH-lay-ohn) Bonaparte, a powerful ruler who had conquered most of Europe. He wished to rebuild France’s empire in North America.&#160;Napol&#233;on’s strategy was to use the French colony of Haiti, in the Caribbean, as a supply base. From there he could send troops to Louisiana. However, in the 1790s enslaved Africans, led by Toussaint Louverture (too-SAN loo-vehr-TOOR), revolted and freed themselves from French rule. Napol&#233;on sent troops to try to regain control of the island, but they were defeated in 1802. This defeat ended his hopes of rebuilding a North American empire.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bc899863a8cb4974bc5ff4407f99bfe1">The American ambassador got a surprising offer during his negotiations with French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand. When the Americans tried to buy New Orleans, Talleyrand offered to sell all of Louisiana.&#160;With his hopes for a North American empire dashed, Napol&#233;on had turned his attention back to Europe. France was at war with Great Britain, and Napol&#233;on needed money for military supplies. He also hoped that a larger United States would challenge British power. Livingston and Monroe knew a bargain when they saw one. They quickly accepted the French offer to sell Louisiana for $15 million.</p>

        <p data-uuid="7373541afacb45aca6968ea390651adf">The news pleased Jefferson. But as a strict&#160;constructionist, he was troubled. The Constitution did not mention the purchase of foreign lands. He also did not like spending large amounts of public money. Nevertheless, Jefferson agreed to the purchase in the belief that doing so was best for the country.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a18245f5139c4df0a03bf2ff5a83c154">On October 20, 1803, the Senate approved the&#160;<dfn title="Louisiana Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</dfn> agreement, which roughly doubled the size of the United States. With the $15 million in the French treasury, Napol&#233;on boasted, “I have given England a rival who, sooner or later, will humble her pride.”<br />

            <p data-uuid="debb5722fdc14781a00286a56bea6bc0">Americans knew little about western Native Americans or the land they lived on. President Jefferson wanted to learn more about the people and land of the West. He also wanted to see if there was a river route that could be taken to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
        
        <p data-uuid="832679ce8db54d10b43740dd8700256f">In 1803 the president asked Congress to fund an expedition to explore the West. To lead it, he chose former army captain <dfn title="Lewis, Meriwether">Meriwether Lewis</dfn>. Lewis then chose his friend Lieutenant <dfn title="Clark, William">William Clark</dfn> to be the coleader of the expedition. To prepare for the journey, Lewis spent weeks studying with experts about plants, surveying, and other subjects. This knowledge would allow him to take careful notes on what he saw. With Clark, Lewis carefully selected about 50 skilled frontiersmen to join the Corps of Discovery, as they called their group.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3b4d5a4787bf4d4dba1cf5ea68a8c823">Lewis and Clark used the Missouri River as their highway through the unknown lands. As they moved upstream, a lookout on the boats kept a sharp eye out for sandbars and for tree stumps hidden underwater. When darkness fell, the weary explorers would pull their boats ashore. They cooked, wrote in their journals, and slept. Swarms of gnats, flies, and mosquitoes often&#160;interrupted their sleep.</p>
        <p data-uuid="24a02eafc1114436a5bf371925972d5d">Insects were not the only cause of sleeplessness for the Corps of Discovery. As weeks passed without seeing any Native Americans, the explorers wondered what their first encounter would be like.<br />
        </p>
        
            <h3 data-uuid="261957c9c3914b49b55b9af40f6faf66">Contact with Native Americans</h3>
           
                <p data-uuid="780e7d84948f415f814b6dc0920d0e28">During the summer of 1804 the Corps of Discovery had pushed more than 600 miles upriver without seeing any Native Americans. But when the men spotted huge buffalo herds in the distance, they guessed that Indian groups would be nearby. Many Indian groups depended on the buffalo for food, clothing, and tools.</p>
            
        <p data-uuid="8ec93b8145054970b865ed53c00653b4">Lewis used interpreters to talk to the leaders of each of the peoples they met. He told them that the United States now owned the land on which the Native Americans lived. Yet the explorers relied on the goodwill of the people they met. <dfn title="Sacagawea (sak-uh-juh-WEE-uh)">Sacagawea</dfn> (sak-uh-juh-WEE-uh), a Shoshone from the Rocky Mountains, accompanied the group with her husband, a French fur trader who lived with the Mandan Indians and served as a guide and interpreter. Sacagawea helped the expedition by naming plants and by gathering edible fruits and vegetables for the group. At one point, the group met with Sacagawea's brother, who provided horses and a guide to lead the expedition across the mountains. The Corps also came into contact with British and Canadian trappers and traders, who were not happy to see them. The traders feared American competition in the beaver fur trade—and the traders would be proved right.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5fc51372ec1649108c89df80c96fc759">After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark&#160;followed the Columbia River. Along the way, they met the powerful Nez Perc&#233;. Like the Shoshone, the Nez Perc&#233; provided the expedition with food. At last, in November 1805, Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean. The explorers stayed in the Pacific Northwest during the rough winter. In March 1806 Lewis and Clark set out on the long trip home.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ee4ae52c1bf9456aa0b0af2e8673be6e">Lewis and Clark had not found a river route across the West to the Pacific Ocean. But they had learned much about western lands and paths across the Rockies. They used this knowledge to produce the first accurate maps of the Louisiana Territory. The explorers also established contact with many Native American groups and collected much valuable information about western plants and animals.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="d1bf87017ba84361be25833a35dfca3e">Other Explorations</h3>
        
            <p data-uuid="6b1cc0cb7ac6498c977eded291a020af">In 1806 a young army officer named <dfn title="Pike, Zebulon">Zebulon Pike</dfn> was sent on another mission to the West. He was ordered to find the starting point of the Red River. This was important because the United States considered the Red River to be a part of the Louisiana Territory’s western border with New Spain.</p>
       
        <p data-uuid="442cb71c91224231b02da9e00f949069">Heading into the Rocky Mountains in present-day Colorado, Pike tried to reach the summit of the mountain now known as Pikes Peak, but he failed. Then&#160;he turned south and traveled through Spanish-held lands until Spanish cavalry arrested him. They suspected Pike of being a spy. When he was finally released, he returned to the United States and reported on his trip. Despite his imprisonment, he praised the opportunities for doing business with the Spanish in the Southwest. Pike’s report offered many Americans their first description of the Southwest. Not all of Pike’s information was accurate, however. For example, he described the treeless Great Plains as a desert. This led many Americans to believe, mistakenly, that the Plains region was useless for farming. </p>
        <p data-uuid="1ed2e894f53246ccad9bacc89484c961">Another explorer, <dfn title="Fr&#233;mont, John C.">John C. Fr&#233;mont</dfn>, also led efforts to open the frontier. With funding from Congress, Fr&#233;mont set off on a five-month expedition to the Rocky Mountains in June 1842. Guide Kit Carson, cartographer Charles Preuss, and a group of about 20 others traveled with him through the present-day states of Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming into Oregon Country. Upon his return, Fr&#233;mont and his wife, Jessie Benton Fr&#233;mont, compiled a report of his journey. The report became a practical guide for future travelers to the West. It detailed the geology, botany, and climate of the region. It also crushed the mistaken belief that the West was a vast desert, attracting more settlers as a result. Buoyed by the success of his first effort, Fr&#233;mont led several more surveys of the American West in the&#160;1840s and 1850s.<br />
