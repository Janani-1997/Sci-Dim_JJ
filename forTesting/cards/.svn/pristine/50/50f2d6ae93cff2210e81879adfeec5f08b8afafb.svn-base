        <p data-uuid="9b24e19607074d8db274f9ba25eb0a9b">Sectional differences had always existed between different regions of the United States. The geographic features of each region contributed to the development of differing economic activities. Revolutionary changes in industry and transportation deepened the differences between North and South. While the northern United States began to focus on industry in the early 1800s, the South remained mainly agricultural.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ff6e5cf8f3774a0cb0fc46239fcf2ab9">Before the American Revolution, three crops dominated southern agriculture—tobacco, rice, and indigo. These crops played a central role in the southern economy and culture. They were produced mostly by enslaved African Americans.</p>
        <p data-uuid="950e05b2dd4e4644a13ba311d1b863ec">After the American Revolution, however, prices for tobacco, rice, and indigo dropped. When crop prices fell, the demand for and the price of slaves also went down. In an effort to protect their incomes, many farmers tried, with little success, to grow other crops that needed less labor. Soon, however, cotton would transform the southern economy and greatly increase the demand for slave labor.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="bb88a80c4a1b4db09bf9ab053d70ac71">Cotton Becomes Profitable</h3>
        <p data-uuid="190d48964b554408865ac01fbc947f91"> Cotton had been grown in the New World for centuries, but it had not been a very profitable crop. Before cotton could be spun into thread for weaving into cloth, the seeds had to be removed from the cotton fibers.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e6be2531ad1744ff9a2689073bc63407">Long-staple cotton, also called black-seed cotton, was fairly easy to process. Workers could pick the seeds from the cotton with relative ease. But long-staple cotton grew well in only a few places in the South. More common was short-staple cotton, which was also known as green-seed cotton. Removing the seeds from this cotton was difficult and time consuming. A worker could spend an entire day picking the seeds from a single pound of short-staple cotton.</p>
        <p data-uuid="585110bc1ab847b9bb85652d927af201">By the early 1790s the demand for American cotton began increasing rapidly. For instance, in Great Britain, new textile factories needed raw cotton that could be used for making cloth. American cotton producers could not keep up with the high demand for their cotton. These producers of cotton needed a machine that could remove the seeds from the cotton more rapidly.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a9aac9a4e9474dc6923cf99ee2b5799b">Eli Whitney’s Cotton Gin</h3>
        <p data-uuid="fba746e876824ff6888dd142701ecd19"> Northerner Eli Whitney finally patented such a machine in 1793. The year before, Whitney had visited a Georgia plantation owned by Catherine Greene. Workers there were using a machine that removed seeds from long-staple cotton. This machine did not work well on short-staple cotton. Greene asked Whitney if he could improve it. By the next spring, Whitney had perfected his design for the <dfn title="cotton gin">cotton gin</dfn>, a machine that removes seeds from short-staple cotton. (<i>Gin</i> is short for “engine.”) The cotton gin used a hand-cranked cylinder with wire teeth to pull cotton fibers from the seeds.</p>
