        <p data-uuid="71d69a65770d49ffa6457ce3b5c8bdde">In an 1858 speech, Lincoln declared, “There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights numerated in the Declaration of Independence—the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Yet as president, Lincoln found <b><dfn title="emancipation">emancipation</dfn></b>, or the freeing of slaves, to be a difficult issue. He did not believe he had the constitutional power. He also worried about the effects of emancipation.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9adc212d864c4743876f88373ce87adc">The Emancipation Proclamation was a military order that freed slaves only in areas controlled by the Confederacy. In fact, the proclamation had little immediate effect. It was impossible for the federal government to enforce the proclamation in the areas where it actually applied—the states in rebellion that were not under federal control. The proclamation did not stop slavery in the border states, where the federal government would have had the power to enforce it. The words written in the Emancipation Proclamation were powerful, but the impact of the document was more symbolic than real. It defined what the Union was fighting against and discouraged Britain from aiding the Confederacy.<br />

        <p data-uuid="2d9efd5c2f8a4acc93342e4d22bbfaf5">Lincoln wanted to be in a strong position in the war before announcing his plan. The Battle of Antietam gave him the victory he needed. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862. The proclamation went into effect on January 1, 1863. As one of the first civil rights documents in United States history, the Emancipation Proclamation continues to impact Americans today as a symbol of equal rights for all Americans. The historic document paved the way for future civil rights legislation, which gave minorities and women more equal rights.</p>

            <p data-uuid="67eafaa1d0c0471bb27b8b3df24ac4f6">Abraham Lincoln is one of the great symbols of American democracy. He was born in a log cabin to a poor family in Kentucky and grew up in Kentucky and Illinois. Lincoln went to school for less than a year but taught himself law and settled in Springfield, where he practiced law and politics.</p>
            <p data-uuid="344e451aff9a443ba28f6d193dff75a4">The issue of slavery defined Lincoln’s entire political career. He was not an abolitionist, but he strongly opposed extending slavery into the territories. In a series of famous political debates against Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois, Lincoln championed his views on slavery and made a brilliant defense of democracy and the Union. “A house divided against itself cannot stand,” he declared in a debate with Douglas.</p>
            <p data-uuid="a148b7c456b34e6ea5b5d87eabbd3453">Elected president in 1860, Lincoln led the nation through the Civil War and worked constantly to preserve a unified nation. In 1863 he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. His address to commemorate the bloody battlefield at Gettysburg is considered to be one of the best political speeches in American history. Only days after the Civil War ended, John Wilkes Booth assassinated Lincoln on April 14, 1865.</p>

        <p data-uuid="346ea54da0964e968acbef517cc8ee6a">New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1862: In “night watch” meetings at many African American churches, worshipers prayed, sang, and gave thanks. When the clocks struck midnight, millions were free. Abolitionists rejoiced. Frederick Douglass called January 1, 1863, “the great day which is to determine the destiny not only of the American Republic, but that of the American Continent.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="9f404ff5cbfa447c9efc857fa3efac6f"> William Lloyd Garrison was quick to note, however, that “slavery, as a system” continued to exist in the loyal slave states. Yet where slavery remained, the proclamation encouraged many enslaved African Americans to escape when the Union troops came near. They flocked to the Union camps and followed them for protection. The loss of slaves crippled the South’s ability to wage war.</p>
