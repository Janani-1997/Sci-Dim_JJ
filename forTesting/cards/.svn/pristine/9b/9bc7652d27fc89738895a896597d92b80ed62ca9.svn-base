        <p data-uuid="07ac29e38c7642b5bc50daf7bfae216f">General Lee launched more attacks within Union territory. As before, his goal was to break the North’s will to fight. He also hoped that a victory would convince other nations to recognize the Confederacy. The three-day battle at Gettysburg was the largest and bloodiest battle of the Civil War. In three days, more than 51,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, captured, or went missing. It was an important victory for the Union, and it stopped Lee’s plan of invading the North.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="1e9ef1d9856f48a1a9c920ecd27a5d69">First Day</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9082043aa2004e2ebb0716da179c5546">In early June 1863 Lee cut across northern Maryland into southern Pennsylvania. His forces gathered west of a small town called Gettysburg. Lee was unaware that Union soldiers were encamped closer to town. He had been suffering from a lack of enemy information for three days because his cavalry chief “Jeb” Stuart was not performing his duties. Stuart and his cavalry had gone off on their own raiding party, disobeying Lee’s orders.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9d5ad993003d4ec299ddca43241af6dc">Another Confederate raiding party went to Gettysburg for boots and other supplies. There, Lee’s troops ran right into Union general George G. Meade’s cavalry, triggering the <b><dfn title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</dfn></b>, a key battle that finally turned the tide against the Confederates. The battle began on July 1, 1863, when the Confederate raiding party and the Union forces began exchanging fire. The larger Confederate forces began to push the Union troops back through Gettysburg.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0944ef96157c47e3a88054a58ba44e04"> The Union soldiers regrouped along the high ground of Cemetery Ridge and Culp’s Hill. General Lee wanted to prevent the Union forces from entrenching themselves. He therefore ordered General Ewell to attack immediately. However, Ewell hesitated and thereby gave the Federals time to establish an excellent defensive position.<br />

        <p data-uuid="099e2ec4c14f4b639fb04b2a4df7bcf6" class="image-above">In fact, Confederate general James Longstreet thought that the Union position was almost impossible to overrun. Instead of attacking, he felt that the Confederate army should move east, take a strong defensive position, and wait for the Union forces to attack them. However, General Lee was not convinced. He believed that his troops were invincible.</p>
        <p data-uuid="62151ab8d1e14efe9c753a11f03d0d5e">The Confederates camped at Seminary Ridge, which ran parallel to the Union forces. Both camps called for their main forces to reinforce them and prepare for combat the next day.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="2b771441ecea46ebbe5b71ac068785dd">Second Day</h3>
        <p data-uuid="e011447b654f42cb90bed29804e2eeb4"> On July 2, Lee ordered an attack on the left side of the Union line. Lee knew that he could win the battle if his troops captured Little Round Top from the Union forces. From this hill, Lee’s troops could easily fire down on the line of Union forces. Union forces and Confederate troops fought viciously for control of Little Round Top. The fighting was particularly fierce on the south side of the hill. There, the 20th Maine led by Colonel Joshua Chamberlain battled the 15th Alabama led by Colonel William Oates. Later, when describing the conflict, Oates said, “The blood stood in puddles in some places in the rocks.” Eventually, the Union soldiers forced the Confederates to pull back from Little Round Top.<br />

        <p data-uuid="dd31eba55d464891825609a2c449bf48">Then, the Confederates attacked Cemetery Hill and Culp’s Hill. The fighting lasted until nightfall. The assault on Cemetery Hill was unsuccessful. The Confederates did manage to take a few trenches on Culp’s Hill. Even so, the Union forces still held a strong defensive position by the day’s end.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="b78ca25965f44e0a9d8a27f00b99a653">Pickett’s Charge</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f57e626ca9034adb9637a023f2006cad">On the third day of battle, Longstreet again tried to convince Lee not to attack. But Lee thought that the Union forces were severely battered and ready to break. Because of this, he planned to attack the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Such a tactic, he felt, would not be expected. Indeed, General Meade left only about 5,750 troops to defend the center.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9501a72646b84343a7590d6a169db2cc"> For over an hour, the Confederates shelled Cemetery Ridge with cannon fire. For a while, the Union cannons fired back. Then, they slacked off. The Confederates assumed that they had seriously damaged the Union artillery. In reality, the Confederate barrage did little damage.<br />

        <p data-uuid="1d433b50535c4651b977f61b73891269">The task of charging the Union center fell to three divisions of Confederate soldiers. General <b><dfn title="Pickett, George">George Pickett</dfn></b> commanded the largest unit. In late afternoon, nearly 15,000 men took part in <b><dfn title="Pickett’s Charge">Pickett’s Charge</dfn></b>. For one mile, the Confederates marched slowly up toward Cemetery Ridge.</p>
        <p data-uuid="94f68bb3f7504ae4b3cd8c688299ec8f">Showered with cannon and rifle fire, they suffered severe losses. But eventually, some of them almost reached their destination. Then, Union reinforcements added to the barrage on the rebels. Soon the Confederates retreated, leaving about 7,500 casualties on the field of battle. Distressed by this defeat, General Lee rode among the survivors and told them, “It is all my fault.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="8839bd82f637434cb74865909b1edc5a">On the fourth day, Lee began to retreat to Virginia. In all, nearly 75,000 Confederate soldiers and 90,000 Union troops had fought during the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a63aeb094a7540a4a9acfd4d6f09900c"> General Meade decided not to follow Lee’s army. This decision angered Lincoln. He felt that Meade had missed an opportunity to crush the Confederates and possibly end the war.</p>

        <p data-uuid="a2b9748b793e44678d9a456cc97c1153">Gettysburg was a turning point in the war. Lee’s troops would never again launch an attack in the North. The Union victory at Gettysburg took place on the day before Grant’s capture of &#173;Vicksburg, Mississippi. These victories made northerners believe that the war could be won.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5f2309a3f26b4e6f86e2a7e7684f5005"> In addition, the Union win at Gettysburg helped to end the South’s search for foreign influence in the war. After Gettysburg, Great Britain and France refused to provide aid to the Confederacy. The South’s attempt at cotton diplomacy failed. The battle is remembered both for its result and for the words President Lincoln said about it.</p>
