                in the Constitution. Therefore, after ratification, many issues surrounding the national government had to be decided quickly. This included questions related to how the government would work, how much power it would have, where its boundaries
                were, and how foreign relationships would be conducted. It was up to the nation’s first leaders to tackle these issues and lay the the foundation for a strong, united nation.</p>
