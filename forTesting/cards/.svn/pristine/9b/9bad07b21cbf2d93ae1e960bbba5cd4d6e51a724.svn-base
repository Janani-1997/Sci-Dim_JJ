        <p data-uuid="3e9ac7809c2f472aa636fb67476cf9cc">In 1866 Congress continued to debate the rules for restoring the Union. Meanwhile, new state legislatures approved by President Johnson had already begun passing laws to deny African Americans’ civil rights. “This is a white man’s government, and intended for white men only,” declared Governor Benjamin F. Perry of South Carolina.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="5e5542da802b48f79eb1d79a6fa74dc0">Black Codes</h3>
        <p data-uuid="bfd4e2217ef74352843e74326a29afd6">Soon, every southern state passed <dfn title="Black Codes">Black Codes</dfn>. They required African Americans to sign work contracts, creating working conditions similar to those under slavery. In most southern states, any African Americans who could not prove they were employed could be arrested. Their punishment might be one year of work without pay. African Americans were also prevented from owning guns. In addition, they were not allowed to rent property except in cities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="34db490bcad24645adca1ca961b19900"> Black Codes in Mississippi and South Carolina also included Apprentice Laws. These laws required law enforcement officials to semiannually report to the probate court orphaned children or children of parents deemed unfit. The probate court was then required to find work for the minor as an apprentice. The former owner had priority in choosing the minor as his apprentice.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5b61177af02f4c34bc04d69f12ad6cf1">Masters had the right to inflict moderate punishment on their apprentices and to recapture runaways. But the codes also required masters to provide food and clothing to their apprentices, teach them a trade, and send them to school.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b0ccd84ff2584fc6a4cee18abf534f52">The Black Codes alarmed many Americans. As one Civil War veteran asked, “If you call this freedom, what do you call slavery?” African Americans organized to oppose the codes. One group sent a petition to officials in South Carolina.</p>

        <p data-uuid="fa6e57d00cd04bcfad0367156beea71c">The Black Codes angered many Republicans. They thought the South was returning to its old ways. Most Republicans were moderates who wanted the South to have loyal state governments. They also believed that African Americans should have rights as citizens. They hoped that the government would not have to force the South to follow federal laws.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d73e7009117848db8e13e6ccf2bde950"><dfn title="Radical Republicans">Radical Republicans</dfn>, on the other hand, took a harsher stance. They wanted the federal government to force change in the South. Like the moderates, they thought the Black Codes were cruel and unjust. The Radicals, however, wanted the federal government to be much more involved in Reconstruction. They feared that too many southern leaders remained loyal to the former Confederacy and would not enforce the new laws. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts were the leaders of the Radical Republicans.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5b4bdcd91e4e4afc8af84850ac00de65">A harsh critic of President Johnson, Stevens was known for his honesty and sharp tongue. He wanted economic and political justice for both African Americans and poor white southerners. Sumner had been a strong opponent of slavery before the Civil War. He continued to argue tirelessly for African Americans’ civil rights, including the right to vote and the right to fair laws.</p>
        <p data-uuid="05391334713b46a6a0e2685369123431"> Both Stevens and Sumner believed that, like Lincoln’s proposed Ten Percent Plan, President Johnson’s Reconstruction plan was too lenient toward the South, thereby making it a failure. Although the Radicals did not control Congress, they began to gain support among moderates when President Johnson ignored criticism of the Black Codes. Stevens believed the federal government could not allow racial inequality to survive.<br />
