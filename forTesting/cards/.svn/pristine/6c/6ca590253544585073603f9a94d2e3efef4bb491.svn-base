        <p data-uuid="5a63a263c6f5414baa517e88e5926cf7">Renewed religious faith often led to involvement in movements to fix the problems created by urban growth. One solution was political action. For example, in 1844 New York City created the first city police force.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b81d587926ef4018aa69f988cd15a55d">Members of the growing middle class, especially women, often led the efforts. Many of the women did not work outside the home and had servants to care for their households. This gave them time to work in reform groups.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="368a41d8e71e476d95e0f589c76bdbd7">Temperance Movement</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3811019fe2ff475f9636407b5406d61a">Many social reformers worked to prevent alcohol abuse. They believed that Americans drank too much. In the 1830s, on average, an American consumed seven gallons of alcohol per year. Countless Americans thought that alcohol abuse caused social problems, such as &#173;family violence, poverty, and criminal behavior.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0862acdf0fe8436792ed284065c98765">Americans’ worries about the effects of alcohol on people led to the growth of a <b><dfn title="temperance movement">temperance movement</dfn></b>. This reform effort urged people to use self-discipline to stop drinking hard liquor.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5263c85315644798a7b1ceec826b0603"> Reformers asked people to limit themselves to beer and wine in small amounts. Groups like the American Temperance Society and the American Temperance Union helped to spread the message. Minister Lyman Beecher spoke widely about the evils of alcohol. He claimed that people who drank alcohol were “neglecting the education of their families—and corrupting their morals.” As a result of the temperance movement, the legislators of the state of Maine outlawed alcohol in 1851. Over the next several years, the legislators of 12 other states outlawed it as well.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="580911e2418c49a08fcd6ff3a50a8621">Prison Reform</h3>
        <p data-uuid="af0e9ec840d94469ada1c8768ad207ae">Another target of reform was the prison system. <b><dfn title="Dix, Dorothea">Dorothea Dix</dfn></b> was a middle-class reformer who visited prisons throughout Massachusetts beginning in 1841. Dix reported that mentally ill people frequently were jailed with criminals. They were sometimes left in dark cells without clothes or heat and were chained to the walls and beaten. Dix spoke of what she saw to the state legislature.</p>
        <p data-uuid="842cee2144294e84afeb34fe0c16aaa2">In response, the Massachusetts government built facilities for the mentally ill. Dix’s work had a nationwide effect. Eventually, more than 100 state hospitals were built to give mentally ill people professional care.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ffd9e747a6a64f4b82e8e5a0396f17d0">Prisons also held runaway children and orphans. Some had survived only by begging or stealing, and they got the same punishment as adult criminals. Boston mayor Josiah Quincy asked that young offenders receive different punishments than adults. In the 1820s several state and local governments founded reform schools for children who had been housed in prisons. There, children lived under strict rules and learned useful skills.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4f26638ac1524001aff2632b98923cdb">Some reformers also tried to end the overcrowding and cruel conditions in prisons. Their efforts led to the creation of houses of correction. These institutions did not use punishment alone to change behavior. They also offered prisoners education.</p>
