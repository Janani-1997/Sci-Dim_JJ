        <p data-uuid="0cbb2e867c8646de8dab4f24de0ce4ee">Factories continued to spread in the 1800s. Craftspeople, who made goods by hand, felt threatened because factories were able to produce low-priced goods more quickly. To compete with factories, shop owners had to hire more workers and pay them less. Shoemaker William Frazier complained about the situation in the mid-1840s. “We have to sit on our seats from twelve to sixteen hours per day, to earn one dollar.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="731ba1fdc194494a81baecd1bf697619">The wages of factory workers also went down as people competed for jobs. A wave of immigration in the 1840s brought people from other, poorer countries. They were willing to work for low pay. More immigrants came to the Northeast, where the mills were located, than to the South. Competition for jobs also came from people unemployed during the financial Panic of 1837. For example, about 50,000 workers in New York City alone lost their jobs.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="3319f318e6714953ababf5be95b916ed">The Beginning of Trade Unions</h3>
        <p data-uuid="cf26bcbe60f64bbcb7eab311f1c3145f">Facing low wages and the fear of losing their jobs, skilled workers formed <b><dfn title="trade unions">trade unions</dfn></b>, groups that tried to improve pay and working conditions. Eventually, unskilled factory workers also formed trade unions, seeking economic equity. Most employers did not want to hire union workers. Employers believed that the higher cost of union employees prevented competition with other manufacturers.</p>
        <p data-uuid="aa2b9150400b4b66acd4a90f55c61baa">Sometimes, labor unions staged protests called <b><dfn title="strike">strikes</dfn></b>. Workers on strike refuse to work until employers meet their demands. Most early strikes were not successful, however. Courts and police usually supported companies, not striking union members.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="b79fc08411294947881187feef4541ae">Labor Reform Efforts</h3>
        <p data-uuid="a6f1bf8ba04f427d980b5b66c41f541d">A strong voice in the union movement was that of millworker <b><dfn title="Bagley, Sarah G.">Sarah G. Bagley</dfn></b>. She wrote magazine articles and made speeches about working in the mills. She organized workers to help change conditions. Bagley founded the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association in 1844 and publicized the struggles of factory laborers. The association’s two main goals were to influence an investigation of working conditions by the Massachusetts state legislature and to obtain a ten-hour workday. Members of the association passed out pamphlets and circulated petitions.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5dea4b1b9aa044369e75676fb170a6b7">President Martin Van Buren had granted a ten-hour workday in 1840 for many federal employees. Bagley wanted this rule to apply to employees of private businesses. These men and women often worked 12 to 14 hours per day, six days per week.</p>
        <p data-uuid="98f644fa4f9d4431abe6f77a0680f64d">Many working men and women supported the ten-hour-workday campaign, despite the opposition of business owners. In 1845 Sarah G. Bagley was elected vice president of the New England Working Men’s&#160;Association. She was the first woman to hold such a high-ranking position in the American labor movement.</p>
        <p data-uuid="50706c0a82664ba1a3ddc114116a2b6b">Over time, the unions achieved some concrete legal victories. Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and a few other states passed ten-hour-workday laws.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5b7274c31a5e4cc19e06d555b143a2a4"> For factory workers in other states, long hours remained common. One witness described how children were “summoned by the factory bell before daylight” and worked until eight o’clock at night “with nothing but [a] recess of forty-five minutes to get their dinner.” Union supporters continued to fight for work reforms such as an end to child labor in factories during the 1800s.<br />
