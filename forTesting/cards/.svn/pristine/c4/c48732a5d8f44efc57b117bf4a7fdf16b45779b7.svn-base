        <p data-uuid="2c7a65cf2a074b8bbe3ddbe1ad89dab2">Even more appealing than Samoa were the Hawaiian Islands. The islands provided an economic opportunity for the United States and a chance to gain even more world power. Hawaiians first saw Europeans in 1778. Trading and whaling ships in the Pacific soon began stopping in Hawaii. In the early 1800s American missionaries came and attempted to convert Hawaiians to Christianity. Missionaries opened businesses and raised crops, such as sugarcane. Some Americans became rich sugar planters.</p>
        <p data-uuid="493fc84ccbb743768150222ab6ed0200"> By the 1840s most shops and shipyards in Hawaii were owned by Americans. Sugar became a leading export of the Hawaiian economy. An 1875 treaty allowed Hawaiian sugar to be shipped duty-free to the United States. (A duty is a tax on imported items.) This agreement helped the Hawaiian sugar industry prosper.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9e897217d59d47688de73d0dcbde36a8">The American planters used their power to force the Hawaiian king to sign a new constitution in 1887. It became known as the Bayonet Constitution because the king was forced to sign it at gunpoint. The constitution granted more power to the planter-controlled legislature. Many Hawaiians feared the foreigners’ increase in power. </p>
        <p data-uuid="0eb9f89aa1eb4233a5011d35beb053b6"> In 1891 the king died, and his sister, <b><dfn title="Liliuokalani (li-lee-uh-who-kuh-LAHN-ee)">Liliuokalani</dfn></b> (li-LEE-uh-woh-kuh-LAHN-ee), became queen. She proposed a new constitution that would return power to the monarchy. American planters in Hawaii saw these plans as threats to their political and economic interests. The planters revolted. John L. Stevens, U.S. minister to Hawaii, called 150 marines ashore to support the revolt. It succeeded without a battle. The planters formed a new government. They asked the U.S. government to annex Hawaii to become part of the United States.<br />

            <p data-uuid="ae306148232943789843295e3e2025f2">Born in Honolulu, Queen Liliuokalani was the first and only queen of Hawaii. She was a defender of Hawaiian traditions and territory. Even after being driven from power in 1893, she continued speaking out on behalf of native-born Hawaiians. In 1897 she traveled to Washington, DC. She met with President Grover Cleveland to argue against the annexation of Hawaii by the United States. Today her reign is a proud reminder of the islands’ history as an independent nation.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b0c406d4ceb642cba5f17c59a9c64ebc">Leaders in the United States already understood the value of the islands. It was in their interest to gain control. In 1887 they had negotiated with Hawaii’s king to allow a U.S. base at Pearl Harbor. It was one of the best natural harbors in the eastern Pacific. The base became an important refueling station for American merchant and military ships bound for Asia. This helped the United States continue to gain world political power. </p>
        <p data-uuid="5d080e5fa1a74f7fbf1f22b31146e1da">Congress voted to annex the Hawaiian Islands in 1898. Hawaii officially changed from an independent country to an American territory. As a territory, Hawaii would fall under the control of the United States. </p>
        <p data-uuid="c65cbe924e8f4f25bde7c7c238f804c2"> With American territory now stretching between two oceans, America was well placed to extend its influence in the Pacific. Through purchase and annexation, the nation began expanding beyond its shores and becoming a world power.<br />
