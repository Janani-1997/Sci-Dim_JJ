Slaveholders were permitted to take suspected fugitives to U.S. commissioners, who decided their fate.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="02a9dbe5ffe542678d5b02866782c148">Details of the Fugitive Slave Act</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9d8753cac9bc4ddfb03015f8dcd791a2">Slaveholders could use testimony from white witnesses, but African Americans accused of being fugitives could not testify. Nor could people who hid or helped a runaway slave—they faced six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Commissioners who rejected a slaveholder’s claim earned $5, while those who returned suspected fugitives to slaveholders earned $10. Clearly, the commissioners benefited from helping slaveholders.</p>

To protest the new law, they held many meetings to publicly denounce it. One such meeting was held in 1850 in the small town of Cazenovia in central New York, a center for abolitionist activity. About 2,000 people—including many former slaves—attended the convention. They listened to speeches, made plans, and raised their voices for freedom.</p>

        <p data-uuid="481bf799fd994857a884198019e8f220">Enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act began immediately. In September 1850—the same month the law was passed—federal marshals arrested African American James Hamlet. They returned him to a slaveholder in Maryland, although he had lived in New York City for three years.</p>
        <p data-uuid="397166483a5347b4a70e130800cf6f69">Thousands of northern African Americans fled to Canada in fear. In the ten years after Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, some 343 fugitive slave cases were reviewed. The accused fugitives were declared free in only 11 cases.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0b9ba4bd2bba4eeeb6a7b2b4c02ded9d">The Fugitive Slave Act upset northerners, who were uncomfortable with the commissioners’ power. Northerners disliked the idea of a trial without a jury. They also disapproved of commissioners’ higher fees for returning slaves. Most were horrified that some free African Americans had been captured and sent to the South.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0c550e68344444bdbabac615eb61bb94">Most northerners opposed to the act peacefully resisted, but violence did erupt. In 1854 <b><dfn title="Burns, Anthony">Anthony Burns</dfn></b>, a fugitive slave from Virginia, was arrested in Boston. Abolitionists used force while trying to rescue him from jail, killing a deputy marshal. A federal ship was ordered to return Burns to Virginia after his trial. Many people in the North, particularly in Massachusetts, were outraged. The event persuaded many to join the abolitionist cause.</p>
