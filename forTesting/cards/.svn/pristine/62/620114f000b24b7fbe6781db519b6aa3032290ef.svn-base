        <p data-uuid="1552cf26fa094c3da994b511876b47de">In early Virginia, people lived on scattered farms rather than in towns. Tobacco farmers established large farms called plantations. Tobacco was so valuable that it was sometimes used as money.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="826b210631b04075b7157c377a0d9224">Headright System</h3>
        <p data-uuid="ed764ba233bf45bd8ce4c87cef72be05"> These plantations were made possible in part by the headright system, which was started by the Virginia Company. Under this system, colonists who paid their own way to Virginia received 50 acres of land. A colonist could earn another 50 acres for every additional person brought from England. Rich colonists who brought servants or relatives to Virginia gained large amounts of land.</p>

        <p data-uuid="81790015e442476fba95840792a2054e">Colonists in Virginia suffered very high death rates, which led to labor shortages. The majority of workers were <b><dfn title="indentured servant">indentured servants</dfn></b>. These servants signed a contract to work for four to seven years for those who paid for their journey to America.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a79961796e8545efa4f0f8a073b1083b">Expansion of Slavery</h3>
        <p data-uuid="48bbe6405a4243cd88ab718c1f953dc5">Not all laborers in Virginia came from Europe. A Dutch ship brought the first Africans to Virginia in 1619. Some Africans were servants; others had been enslaved. Some African servants became successful farmers when their contracts ended.</p>
        <p data-uuid="553f7808c6e24d21b36a63e46600bfb6"> The demand for workers was soon greater than the supply of people willing to work as indentured servants. Over time, the cost of slaves fell. These factors led some colonists to turn to slave labor. By the mid-1600s most Africans in Virginia were being kept in lifelong slavery.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9498be3cacd94c46891b8c6e5eb0987a">Before 1619 most of Virginia's settlers were men. Only a few women and children lived in the colony. It was not until 1619 that the Virginia Company decided to send more women to the colony. The arrival of 90 English women in 1620 allowed more settlers to start families. As a result many settlers chose to make a permanent home in Virginia.</p>

Others could make useful items for the home, such as soap and candles. As the Virginia colony grew, more women arrived. Many came as indentured servants. </p>
        <p data-uuid="053435cde47145829e2377509f7d7c54"> Life was hard for children in colonial Virginia. They spent much of their time working. Boys who lived on farms helped take care of animals, plant crops, and chop firewood. Girls helped cook and clean. They also spun and wove cloth and helped make butter, soap, and candles.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="b0c9949027dc4205bba35e48cc2c3a92">Bacon’s Rebellion</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b06aa91e3c404edfa2beed4aa6b51224">As plantations grew, the economy of Jamestown began to expand. Soon, colonial officials began to ask for more taxes. During the mid-1600s poor colonists protested the higher taxes. They were also upset about the governor’s policies toward Native Americans. They thought the colony was not well protected against attack. In 1676 a group of former indentured servants led by Nathaniel Bacon attacked some friendly Native Americans. Bacon opposed the governor’s policies promoting trade with Native Americans. He also thought the colonists should be able to take the Native Americans’ land. When the governor tried to stop him, Bacon and his followers attacked and burned Jamestown in an uprising known as <b><dfn title="Bacon’s Rebellion">Bacon’s Rebellion</dfn></b>.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a401eaab48d1486ab6548a3a4b1c4471">At one point, Bacon controlled much of the colony. He died of fever, however, and the rebellion soon ended.</p>
