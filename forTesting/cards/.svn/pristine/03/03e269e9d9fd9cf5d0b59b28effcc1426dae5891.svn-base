        <p data-uuid="6a39d8dd36ee4fa69f3bf32fb6309b2c">New educational opportunities drew more women into the Progressive movement. In the late 1800s women began attending women’s colleges, such as Smith College in Massachusetts and Vassar College in New York, in record numbers. In 1870 only about 20 percent of college students were women. By 1910 that number had doubled. The goal of female students was “to develop as fully as may be the powers of womanhood,” said Sophia Smith, founder of Smith College.</p>

        <p data-uuid="276f91aaafad4bb7b4f1f4c0ebeb116b">Many female graduates entered fields such as social work and teaching. They found it much harder to enter professions such as law and medicine, which were dominated by men. Denied access to such professions, women often put their education to use by becoming active in reform. Women’s clubs campaigned for causes such as temperance, women’s suffrage, child welfare, and political reform.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="db2dfa67d6a5445086cb18f7b8a9e2e7">The Temperance Movement</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c784900a7e53419c8f7bebea8a46ccbf">In the mid-1800s many of these reformers blamed social problems such as family violence and criminal behavior on a number of factors, including urbanization and immigration. They also blamed problems on alcohol consumption. As a result, many groups took up the cause of temperance, or avoidance of alcohol.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d3ad17a4fdd44ad184350f22578f4b46">In 1874 reformers from many different backgrounds formed the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), which fought for adoption of local and state laws restricting the sale of alcohol. Under the leadership of Frances Willard, the organization started 10,000 branches. More than 1,000 saloons were forced to shut down as a result of temperance supporters’ efforts.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1e241dbd23b846c682cc17b27221b19e"> One especially radical temperance fighter chose more dramatic tactics to fight for her cause. In the 1890s Carry Nation became famous for storming into saloons with a hatchet and smashing liquor bottles.&#160;</p>

With fiery speeches, dramatic raids, and a canny sense of publicity, she became a national figure in the temperance cause. She urged other women to follow her lead and attack the problem at the source.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8bd44f243ffb4a2fb376d2edc7c132ba">Eventually the temperance movement was victorious. In 1917 Congress proposed the <b><dfn title="Eighteenth Amendment">Eighteenth Amendment</dfn></b>, which banned the production, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages throughout the United States. The states ratified the amendment in 1919.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a1954719d0d9479ab03c3f6ebc8d1c3e">The Right to Vote</h3>
        <p data-uuid="261292027eed4d648c40bb4fb86e7ec0">Women reformers also fought for suffrage, or the right to vote. Many people at this time opposed giving women the vote. Political bosses, for instance, worried about the anticorruption efforts of women. Some business leaders worried that women voters would support minimum wage and child labor laws. Other people believed that women should only be homemakers and mothers and not politically active citizens.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9965946df24545d98c63f3b1069683ad">In spite of such opposition, the women’s suffrage movement began to gain national support in the 1890s. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony founded the <dfn title="National American Woman Suffrage Association">National American Woman Suffrage Association</dfn> (NAWSA) in 1890 to promote the cause of women’s suffrage. That same year, women won the right to vote in Wyoming. Colorado, Idaho, and Utah soon followed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="043995c0ac8048028f7975aeadcb5545">Carrie Chapman Catt became president of NAWSA in 1900. Catt mobilized more than 1 million volunteers for the movement. She argued that women should have a voice in creating laws that affected them. “We women demand an equal voice,” she said. “We shall accept nothing less.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="9e5509d27a1e45448c4a2683af4f83aa"> Some women believed that NAWSA did not go far enough. In 1913 <b><dfn title="Paul, Alice">Alice Paul</dfn></b> founded what would become the National Woman’s Party (NWP). The NWP used parades, public demonstrations, picketing, hunger strikes, and other means to draw attention to the suffrage cause. Paul even organized picketing in front of the White House. Paul and other NWP leaders were jailed for their actions.</p>
