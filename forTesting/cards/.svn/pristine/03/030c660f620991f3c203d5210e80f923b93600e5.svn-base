These groups of people share a common interest that motivates them to take political action. Interest groups organize speeches and rallies to support their cause. Sometimes they hire lobbyists, people whose job involves trying to influence the thinking of legislators or government officials. However, citizens need not join a group to influence government. They can write letters to leaders of government or attend city council meetings. Active political participation is an important responsibility for U.S. citizens and immigrants alike.</p>
