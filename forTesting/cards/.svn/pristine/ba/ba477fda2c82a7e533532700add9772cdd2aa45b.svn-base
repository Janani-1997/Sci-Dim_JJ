Since many people lost their jobs, families were often forced to split up, as individual members roamed the country in search of work. To help their families buy food, children often had to drop out of school and take very low-paying jobs. Others left home to fend for themselves. One boy wrote this diary entry in 1932: </p>

As white families moved West in search of jobs, Mexican Americans found it harder to get work. In California local leaders and unions convinced the government to deport many Mexican-born workers. Some of the workers’ children were American-born, which made them U.S. citizens, but they were deported anyway.<br />

By 1932 unemployment had reached 50 percent in the African American neighborhood of Harlem in New York City. One man recalled traveling around Michigan in search of work. He went into a factory that was hiring workers:</p>

Bethune was one of several African Americans who Roosevelt appointed to his administration. Other members included Walter White, Robert C. Weaver, and William Henry Hastie. These advisers became known as the Black Cabinet. Their role was to advance the concerns of African Americans in the Roosevelt White House. They stood out as a powerful symbol of rising African American influence in government.</p>

She encouraged the president to include African Americans in his recovery programs. In 1939 the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused to rent their auditorium to the African American opera singer Marian Anderson. In protest, Eleanor Roosevelt resigned her membership in the DAR. She then helped Anderson arrange a concert at the base of the Lincoln Memorial. Some 75,000 people attended. Millions more heard the national radio broadcast of the concert. Anderson later gave a private performance at the White House.<br />
