        <p data-uuid="e69abece46134bad80cf08851fe42d27">Since the early 1800s Americans had pushed steadily westward, moving even beyond the territory of the United States. They traveled by canoe and flatboat, on horseback, and by wagon train. A few even walked much of the way. Some Americans believed it was the country’s <dfn title="manifest destiny">manifest destiny</dfn>, or obvious fate, to move westward and settle land all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Writer John O’Sullivan coined the term in 1845. He wrote that it was America’s “manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole continent which Providence [God] has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty . . . ”<br />

                <p data-uuid="d6f2b2f74dbe40d8954c8133f559e521" class="caption">John Gast made this painting, titled <i>American Progress,</i> in 1872. It
                    illustrates many of the central ideas of American expansion. It shows some
                    realistic aspects of westward movement, such as wagons, buffalo, Native
                    Americans, and telegraph lines. But with the image of the woman, who represents
                    the spirit of manifest destiny, Gast captures the feeling of many Americans
                    about expansion—that it was America’s purpose to possess and settle the lands
                    beyond the Mississippi River.&#160;</p>

        <p data-uuid="dc1e788a08c741e7b1108a6fb4f6a8ad">The initial rush to the West, however, had little to do with O’Sullivan’s grand&#160;democratic experiment. Rather, one of its chief driving forces was a hat. The “high hat,” made of water-repellent beaver fur, was popular in the United States and Europe. While acquiring fur for the hats, French, British, and American companies gradually killed off the beaver population in the East. Companies moved west in search of more beavers. Most of the first non-Native Americans who traveled to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest were fur traders and trappers.<br />

These adventurers were some of the first easterners to explore and map the Rocky Mountains and lands west of them. Mountain men lived lonely and often dangerous lives. They trapped animals on their own, far from towns and settlements. Mountain men such as Jedediah Smith, Manuel Lisa, Jim Bridger, and Jim Beckwourth survived many hardships during their search for wealth and adventure. To survive on the frontier, mountain men adopted Native American customs and clothing. In addition, they often married Native American women. The Indian wives of trappers often worked hard to contribute to the trappers’ success.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f5e6cdd3de43429885998d7e860d8ded">Pioneer William Ashley saw that frequently bringing furs out of the Rocky Mountains was expensive. He asked his traders to stay in the mountains and meet once a year to trade and socialize. This practice helped make the fur trade more profitable. The yearly meeting was known as the rendezvous. At the rendezvous, mountain men and Native American trappers sold their fur to fur-company agents. It was thus important to bring as many furs as possible. One trapper described the people at a typical rendezvous in 1837. He saw Americans, Canadian French, some Europeans, and “Indians, of nearly every&#160;tribe in the Rocky Mountains.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="1b40758ce7b14120aa4493dd41c453c0">The rendezvous was filled with celebrating and storytelling. At the same time, the meeting was also about conducting business. Western artist Alfred Jacob Miller described how trade was begun in the rendezvous camp.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f7a2f82d81fb4c10baa10f539429d02b">In 1811 John Jacob Astor founded a fur-trading post called Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River. Astoria was one of the first American settlements in what became known as Oregon Country. American Indians occupied the region, which was rich in forests, rivers, and wildlife. However, Britain, Russia, Spain, and the United States all claimed the land. The United States based its claim on the exploration of merchant captain Robert Gray, who had reached the mouth of the Columbia River in 1792.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="38c40ed91bba4b3e81fdbd13e0ae92d5">Recognizing the huge economic value of the Pacific Northwest, the United States made treaties in which Spain and Russia gave up their claims to various areas. The United States also signed treaties with Britain allowing both countries to occupy Oregon Country, the Columbia River, and its surrounding lands. </p>
        <p data-uuid="d7bb89d10bdf476bac9405e60495cbbb">By the 1840s the era of American fur trading in the Pacific Northwest was drawing to a close. The demand for beaver furs had fallen because fashions changed. Too much trapping had also greatly reduced the number of beavers. Some mountain men gave up their work and moved back east. Their daring stories, however, along with the treaties made by the U.S. government, inspired other Americans to move west. Lured by rich resources and a mild climate, easterners poured into Oregon Country in the 1840s. These new settlers soon replaced the mountain men on the frontier.<br />
