        <p data-uuid="50606ad5edc24b0182959d462c06a05e">Armed rebellion by enslaved persons was the most extreme form of resistance to slavery. Gabriel Prosser planned an attack on Richmond, Virginia, in 1800. In 1822 Denmark Vesey planned a revolt in Charleston, South Carolina. Both plots were betrayed, and the leaders, as well as numerous followers, were hanged.</p>
        <p data-uuid="baec5167a5544dbb8b1b625330c34307"> The most famous revolt was <dfn title="Nat Turner’s Rebellion">Nat Turner’s Rebellion</dfn>, which took place in 1831 in Southampton County, Virginia. <dfn title="Turner, Nat">Nat Turner</dfn> planned to gain freedom by killing slaveholders and their families. On August 21, Turner gathered about 70 followers and encouraged them with these words:</p>

        <p data-uuid="34e65aea0d194526acee7221edfa97d4">Turner and his followers killed about 55 white men, women, and children. The rebellion was quickly put down. Most of Turner’s men were captured when their ammunition ran out, and some were killed. Dozens of innocent slaves who played no part in the uprising also were put to death. Turner managed to evade capture for six weeks. After he was caught, he was tried and hanged.<br />

            <p data-uuid="651830190d664e84beaf11cb752ccc64">Nat Turner was born into slavery in Virginia. As a child, he learned to read and write and became an enthusiastic reader of the Bible. He soon gained a reputation in the local slave community for his religious beliefs. Enslaved people regularly gathered in forest clearings to listen to his powerful sermons.</p>
            <p data-uuid="954eedd677794e4ba115b8aaafb46d3c">Turner believed that he had been called by God to free the slaves, by armed rebellion if necessary. When a solar eclipse took place in August 1831, he interpreted it as a sign that it was time to revolt. In an account of events that he dictated to a white lawyer before his execution, Turner defended the justice of his cause. He was a “prophet,” he claimed, called by God to commit his violent acts.</p>

        <p data-uuid="2e0086cb6a0d47ddabb9086f8c544947">Turner’s rebellion spread fear throughout the South. Whites killed hundreds of African Americans in revenge. The state of Virginia even considered ending slavery because of the upheaval, but the proposal was narrowly defeated. Most southern state legislatures, however, passed harsh laws that further restricted the limited freedoms of both enslaved and free African Americans. For African Americans in the South, the grip of slavery grew ever tighter.</p>
