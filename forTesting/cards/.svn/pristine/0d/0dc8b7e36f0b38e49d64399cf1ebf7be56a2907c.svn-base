            American population. Measles, smallpox, and typhus were common in Europe. As a
            result, most adult Europeans were <span><b><dfn title="immune">immune</dfn></b></span>,
            or had a natural resistance, to them. Native Americans, however, had never been
            exposed to such diseases and had no immunity to them. As a result, many Native
            Americans became terribly sick after their first encounters with Europeans.
            Millions of them died in the years after Columbus reached the New World.</p>
        <p data-uuid="892d4a6ac32347d5993231c34d0ebf88">
            No
            one knows exactly how many Native Americans died from European diseases, but
            the loss of life was staggering. Spanish author Fern&#225;ndez de Oviedo reported in
            1548 about the destruction of the Native Americans of Hispaniola. He reported
            that, of the estimated 1 million Indians who had lived on the island in 1492,
            “there are not now believed to be at the present time . . . five hundred
            persons [left].” In North America the Native American population north of
            Mexico was about 10 million when Columbus arrived. This number would drop to
            less than a million. The drop in the native population played a major role in
            the emerging need for an alternative labor force.<br />

                    The
                    Native American populations of the Americas decreased dramatically due to
                    European diseases. This image is an illustration from a 16th-century account by

            a mainstay of the colonial economic <span>structure</span>.
            Spain and Portugal established sugar plantations that relied on large numbers
            of native laborers. In the 1600s English tobacco farmers in North America also
            needed workers for their plantations. With a lack of Native American workers,
            they, too, needed another source of labor. Plantation owners in both North and
            South America wanted a cheap work force.</p>
        <p data-uuid="837f2b901c094b598232833cb6eff3cf">
            Some
            colonists, including Spanish priest Bartolom&#233; de Las Casas, suggested using
            enslaved Africans as workers. Africans had already developed immunity to
            European diseases. The colonists soon agreed that slaves from West Africa could
            be the solution to their labor needs.<br />
