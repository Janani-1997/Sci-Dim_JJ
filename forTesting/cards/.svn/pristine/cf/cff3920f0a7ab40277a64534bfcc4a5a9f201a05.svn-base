        <p data-uuid="10da9bd88a5b4accb500c8be755369b6">Though Europe was at peace in the early 1900s, relations between European nations were not necessarily friendly. In fact, feelings of fear and distrust were growing among European powers such as Germany, France, Great Britain, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. This dangerous tension had several important causes.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="f98318d04cbf42e4b7cd80f74e3ce09b">Tensions in Europe</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b741605fb86b490090e1f47664d5b7e7">One cause of tension was the rise of nationalism in the 1800s. Nationalism is a strong sense of pride and loyalty to one’s nation or culture. Nationalism inspired people who shared a language or culture to want to unite politically. In 1871, for example, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm I brought together several German states to form the nation of Germany.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0b285d818e27427ab939175f07fe319c"> While nationalism helped bring stability to Germany, it caused instability in other places. The empire of Austria-Hungary included people from many different cultural groups. One of these groups was the Slavs. Slavic nationalists wanted to break away from Austria-Hungary and join the independent Slavic country of Serbia on the Balkan Peninsula. Leaders of Austria-Hungary reacted angrily, seeing this movement as a threat to their empire.<br />

        <p data-uuid="3187e457cfb947b4b4ead1fc771b8538">Another source of tension in Europe was imperialism. Britain’s huge empire, stretching from Africa to Asia, brought it wealth and power. Eager to share in such benefits, other European powers competed for control of overseas territories. Fierce competition for territory took place within Europe as well. For example, Germany had taken the Alsace-Lorraine region from France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. France wanted it back.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5c0caf415e08438fb0b5fa750a68f3c2">In this competitive atmosphere, nations focused their resources on <b><dfn title="militarism">militarism</dfn></b>—the aggressive strengthening of armed forces. European nations raced to build armies and navies that were larger than ever before.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7d7d6a96b7174765b37528d49ab8649e"> As nations became more powerful, they sought to protect themselves by forming new alliances. Germany formed an alliance with Austria-Hungary in 1879. In this alliance system, each promised to defend the other in case of enemy attack. Concerned with Germany’s growing power, France and Russia created their own alliance in 1893. Britain joined France and Russia in 1907.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="88d2863dab804453bdea9ec0b9dbb26c">The Spark</h3>
        <p data-uuid="0c4dfb1f624b421ea4a6baae31c77b6a">With so much hostility dividing the nations of Europe, a German general felt that “a European war is bound to come sooner or later.” All that was needed was a spark to set Europe on fire. That spark flew from the Balkan province of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0d6f6135b2e74512b1d8ffd789992f75">Bosnia and Herzegovina had gained independence from Turkish rule in 1878. In 1908, however, Austria-Hungary annexed the province. Slavic nationalists resisted violently—they wanted the region to be part of Serbia.</p>

While riding through the streets, they were shot and killed by a 19-year-old Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="71e8223ba885457ca02de9bf0eef52f2">The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand shattered Europe’s fragile peace. Determined to crush Serbia and the Slavic nationalists, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Very quickly, other countries were pulled into the fighting because of their pledged alliances. Russia had promised to support Serbia in case of war. It began to <b><dfn title="mobilize">mobilize</dfn></b>, or prepare its military for war. On August 1 Germany, Austria-Hungary’s ally, declared war on Russia. Two days later, Germany also declared war on France, Russia’s ally. To reach France quickly, the German army marched into Belgium on August 4. Britain, which had promised to support Belgium, then declared war on Germany.<br />
