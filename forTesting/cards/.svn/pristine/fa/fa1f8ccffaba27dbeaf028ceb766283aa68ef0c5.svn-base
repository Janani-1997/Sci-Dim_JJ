            growing numbers of Americans began to criticize the war. “The peaceniks [war
            protesters] these days are legion [many],” said Charlotte Keyes, who helped
            organize a group called Women Strike for Peace. “They are ninety-years-old and fifteen,
            heads of families and housewives with babies, students, [and] young people.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="3e9bb15feeaa42baad74e588302df02f">College students often took the lead in organizing antiwar
            protests. One of the most active protest groups was <b><dfn title="Students for a Democratic Society">Students for a Democratic Society</dfn></b> (SDS). Members of SDS
            protested the draft as well as companies that made weapons used in Vietnam.</p>
        <p data-uuid="88baa84e698748d18bcb23061e6b733a">
            By the end of 1968, students had held antiwar
            demonstrations on nearly 75 percent of college campuses. Some young men protested
            by publicly burning their draft cards. Others avoided military service by
            moving to Canada. Many Americans, however, criticized the antiwar movement as
            anti-American. In 1970, for example, thousands of construction workers marched
            in New York City, shouting, “All the way with the U.S.A.”</p>

            antiwar movement was part of a rejection of traditional values and government
            authority. Some young people chose to “drop out” of mainstream society and
            built a counterculture—a culture with its own values and ways of behaving.
            Members of this counterculture, called <b><dfn title="hippies">hippies</dfn></b>,
            emphasized individual freedom, nonviolence, and communal sharing. Hippies
            expressed their rejection of traditional society by growing their hair long and
            wearing unusual clothes. They promoted openness and were sometimes called
            “flower children.”</p>

            protesters upset many Americans. Commentators described a “generation gap,” or
            division between older and younger Americans. “I know of no time in our history
            when the gap between the generations has been wider,” said one university
            professor.</p>

        <p data-uuid="c1d6aed5c7d64cec81cbdf66a5769e39">News of the Tet Offensive led
            to a sharp drop in the popularity of President Johnson. In early 1968 the percentage
            of Americans who approved of Johnson’s performance as president fell from 48 to
            36. The number of Americans who approved of the way Johnson was handling the
            war was even lower. As the 1968 presidential election approached, Johnson was
            even losing support within his own Democratic Party. On March 31 he went on
            live television and told Americans: “I shall not seek, and I will not accept,
            the nomination of my party for another term as president.”</p>

            Johnson and the Vietnam War. Angry debates inside the convention hall were
            matched by antiwar protests on the streets. When police officers moved in to
            stop the demonstrations, a riot broke out. Television cameras broadcast live
            images of the violent chaos in Chicago. More than 100 police officers and 100
