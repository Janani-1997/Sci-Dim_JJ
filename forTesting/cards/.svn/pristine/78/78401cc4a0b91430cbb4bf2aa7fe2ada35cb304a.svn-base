        <p data-uuid="47c8457fd5ff49c6b2fbdd16a643907d">The Continental army disbanded, or dissolved, soon after the United States and Britain signed the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress could not force states to provide soldiers for an army. Without an army, the national government found it difficult to protect its citizens against foreign threats.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6b15fa801f6a4d51be9fb6b82b56032a"> It was also difficult to enforce international treaties such as the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The United States found it especially hard to force the British to turn over “with all convenient speed” their forts on the American side of the Great Lakes. The United States wanted to gain control of these forts because they protected valuable land and fur-trade routes. Still, Britain was slow to withdraw from the area. A British official warned against the United States trying to seize the forts by force. He said that any attempt to do so would be opposed by the thousands of British soldiers who had settled in Canada after the Revolution “who are ready to fly to arms at a moment's warning.”</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="b31d6c054b9b4b9a8cac6c9cb0e72187">International Trade</h3>
        <p data-uuid="77e71f9cbb2044bc9296f662135077e7">The United States also faced problems trading with Great Britain. After the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Britain closed many of its ports to American ships. Before the Revolutionary War, colonial ships had traded a great deal with the British West Indies and stopped there on their way to other destinations. This travel and trading stopped after 1783.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ded7e7540d2c4428bd04073db231d3ff"> In addition, Britain forced American merchants to pay high <b><dfn title="tariff">tariffs</dfn></b>—taxes on imports or exports. The tariffs applied to goods such as rice, tobacco, tar, and oil that were grown or mined in the United States and then sold in Britain. Merchants had to raise prices to cover the tariffs. Ultimately, the costs would be passed on to customers, who had to pay higher prices for the goods. The economic condition of the country was getting worse by the day.</p>

        <p data-uuid="8555acdb8647486aabdbcb45458a534a">In 1784 Spanish officials closed the lower Mississippi River to U.S. shipping. Western farmers and merchants were furious because they used the Mississippi to send goods to eastern and foreign markets. Congress tried to work out an agreement with Spain, but the plan did not receive a majority vote in Congress. The plan could not be passed. As a result, Spain broke off the negotiations.</p>
        <p data-uuid="70e532aeec5447f4a6444aeb16580254"> Many state leaders began to criticize the national government. Rhode Island's representatives wrote, “Our federal government is but a name; a mere shadow without substance [power].” Critics believed that Spain might have continued to negotiate if the United States had possessed a strong military. These leaders believed that the national government needed to be more powerful.<br />

        <p data-uuid="13fb5c4785fa4d6986417012e2f1ca01"> The closing of markets in the British West Indies seriously affected the U.S. economy. James Madison of Virginia wrote about the crisis.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5f30cc2404324f54be83479dc8f814d9">Farmers could no longer export their goods to the British West Indies. They also had to hire British ships to carry their goods to British markets, which was very expensive. American exports dropped while British goods flowed freely into the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2ed87f5fb8054d1cb7bf131611855bbc">This unequal trade caused serious economic problems for the new nation. British merchants could sell manufactured products in the United States at much lower prices than locally made goods. This difference in prices hurt American businesses.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a243c8c98e1d46a4aaa3d67fd0834145"> The Confederation Congress could not correct the problem because it did not have the authority either to pass tariffs or to order the states to pass tariffs. The states could offer little help. If one state passed a tariff, the British could simply sell their goods in another state. Most states did not cooperate in trade matters. Instead, states worked only to increase their own trade rather than working to improve the trade situation for the whole country.</p>

As a result of the trade problems with Britain, American merchants began looking for other markets such as China, France, and the Netherlands. Despite such attempts, Britain remained the most important trading partner of the United States.</p>
