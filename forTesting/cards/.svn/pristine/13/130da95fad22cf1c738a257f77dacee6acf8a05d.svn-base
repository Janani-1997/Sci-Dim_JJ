        <p data-uuid="284e8de41474411d861e6734222e823e">By the early 1700s Spain’s colony in Mexico was thriving. However, in the territories to the north—which included the modern states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas—the situation was very different. Few Spaniards lived in these largely barren territories. The Spanish government, though, feared losing territory to attacks by neighbors. They wanted to establish settlements that would secure the Spanish claim to what we now call the Southwest. However, the Spanish did not form colonies like the English had on the East Coast. Instead, they established small individual settlements.<br />

        <p data-uuid="adce304052844529b1643a9238795d22">There were three major types of Spanish settlements. Missions were religious settlements. Each mission housed a small number of priests and others who worked to teach local Native Americans about Christianity and the Spanish way of life. The Native Americans also grew crops to feed themselves and the priests. To protect the missions from attacks, the Spanish built presidios, or forts. The soldiers based at a presidio could ride out to defend the priests at any nearby missions. Finally, the Spanish also created towns, sometimes called pueblos, near some missions. In these towns, Spanish citizens would live, grow crops, and raise cattle. Although missions, presidios, and towns were often located near each other, each had to be able to support itself. No one kind of settlement could depend entirely on support from others or from Spain to guarantee its survival.<br />

        <p data-uuid="94cc09acc08542268c587047348a1657">The political situation in the Southwest changed when Mexicans moved to overthrow Spanish rule in the early 1800s. In September 1810 <b><dfn title="Hidalgo y Costilla, Father Miguel">Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla</dfn></b>, a Mexican priest, led a rebellion of about 80,000 poor Indians and mestizos, or people of Indian and Spanish ancestry. They hoped that if Mexico became independent from the Spanish monarchy, their lives would improve. Hidalgo’s revolt failed, but the rebellion he started grew. In 1821 Mexico became independent. In 1824 it adopted a republican constitution that declared rights for all Mexicans.</p>

The first 300 families became known as the Old Three Hundred. Austin’s successful colony attracted other agents, and American settlers flocked to the region.</p>

The two groups generally lived in separate communities. Over time, Texas developed a culture that was distinct from the rest of Mexico and from the United States. </p>
        <p data-uuid="5b0ea310068e45e4a70546741b5b3e9f"> In exchange for cheap land, settlers had to obey Mexican laws. But some settlers often explicitly ignored these laws. For example, despite restrictions on slavery, many brought slaves. Concerned that it was losing control of the growing American population, Mexico responded. In 1830 it banned further settlement by Americans. Angry about the new law, many Texans, as they came to be known, began to think of gaining independence from Mexico.<br />
