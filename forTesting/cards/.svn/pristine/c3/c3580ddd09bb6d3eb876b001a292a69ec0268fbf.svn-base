        <p data-uuid="da1eb69e0cd84500ab5fec32be757a3f">The Spanish and the Portuguese were the early leaders in overseas exploration. They dominated the colonization of the New World through the 1500s. However, Spain and Portugal focused on Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. They left much of North America unexplored. The English, French, and Dutch explored North America. These nations then sought to expand their own empires there.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a1ca330cad894af2a97ce8a6ec4b4c98"> As their empires grew throughout the 1500s and into the 1600s, Europeans acquired a new tool for understanding their world. The Mercator projection map had been created especially for sailors. Although the far northern and southern regions were distorted on the map, the regions where Europeans wanted to explore and claim land were shown fairly well. This map would have helped explorers plan their journeys. It also showed the vast areas where they might find great riches and expand their presence.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="e8262951d20e444fbb42525480e20cb6">English Presence in the New World</h3>
        <p data-uuid="70a9b1a4da3b4980a5098df67f1058ab">In the late 1500s England decided to set up a permanent settlement in North America. This colony was to establish an English presence in the New World. Sir Walter Raleigh received a <b><dfn title="charter">charter</dfn></b>, a document giving him permission to start a colony. In 1584 he sent an expedition that landed in present-day Virginia and North Carolina. Raleigh named the entire area Virginia.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2d8a210460614e7b85763d48dfc71ee3"> The following year, Raleigh sent another group to found a colony on Roanoke Island, off the coast of North Carolina. The English colonists at Roanoke found life hard. They fought with Native Americans and had trouble finding and growing food. After only a year, the remaining colonists returned to England.</p>

            <p data-uuid="e12f947cec81483e99ba6ae325d21414">In November 1558 a smart, red-headed princess named Elizabeth became the third woman in history to rule England. At the time England faced many problems. There were few jobs and a shortage of food, and England owed money to other countries. The 25-year-old Elizabeth faced great challenges. </p>
            <p data-uuid="38dd0ccb91f54e009ab3be2d68e71269"> As queen, Elizabeth transformed England into a world power. Under her leadership the government of England paid its debts. Elizabeth used England's new wealth to create a powerful navy. She was also the first English monarch to support colonization of North America. She granted Sir Walter Raleigh permission to establish a permanent settlement there.</p>

        <p data-uuid="0c942fcd13e14488bb0f4d7e6976e0ce">John White, a talented artist, and 150 colonists resettled Roanoke in the spring of 1587. White’s granddaughter, Virginia Dare, was the first English colonist born in North America. After a few months, White went back to England to get more supplies. War with Spain prevented White from returning for three years. When he came back, White found the colony deserted. The only clue he found to the fate of the colonists was the word <i>Croatoan,</i> the name of a nearby island, carved into a post. Did the colonists try to escape a Native American attack by fleeing to the island? Or did they intermarry and blend with the friendly Croatan tribe? White never found out. To this day, no one is certain what happened to the “lost colony” at Roanoke.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="abfa060c704e415aaf98f5eb1b361da5">French Presence in the New World</h3>
        <p data-uuid="e3b05499df084757833c5a133f5cb36c">France built its first North American settlements in Florida, when Huguenots started a few small colonies there in 1564. One French settler, Jean Ribault, had plans for expansion. In September 1565 he launched an attack by sea on the Spanish settlement at Saint Augustine. However, a hurricane blew the French ships south of Saint Augustine and smashed them on the rocks. The Spanish soon drove the remaining French colonists out of Florida.</p>
        <p data-uuid="973a40d8818e41de8e11fc49cdc34bed">Religious wars in France slowed further French efforts to colonize North America. When the religious conflicts ended, the French renewed efforts to settle present-day eastern Canada. The explorations of Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain gave France a claim to this region.</p>

        <p data-uuid="df6be2b30e1f47b6a8dd28eaed4714b6">Champlain followed Cartier’s old paths. Over the years he made many journeys along the Saint Lawrence River. He also visited the Great Lakes, led by Native American guides. During his travels Champlain met Native Americans called the Algonquin. Some Algonquins formed alliances with the French explorer.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c4a4879e8049496c9e242c7f30218069">In 1608 Champlain founded a small colony on the Saint Lawrence River. He named the colony Quebec. This trading post opened fur-trading routes for the French throughout the region. Champlain’s explorations became the basis of France’s claim to much of Canada.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b5766e55c42f44729f0846a4b5ad37c4">In the late 1600s the French began spreading out from the Saint Lawrence River. Calling their North American territory New France, French fur traders, explorers, and missionaries were all on the move.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f4e499b155cc40649868c4cdd2519a88">In the 1650s French missionaries told stories about “a beautiful river, large, broad, and deep.” In 1673 explorer Louis Jolliet (jahl-ee-ET) and missionary Jacques Marquette set out to find this great river, the Mississippi. (Hernando de Soto was the first European to find the Mississippi River, in 1541.) Jolliet and Marquette reached the river and traveled down it as far as present-day Arkansas.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f77abec6119d4a78a6944f97246f7d7d"> Nine years later Ren&#233;-Robert de La Salle followed the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. He claimed the Mississippi Valley for King Louis XIV of France. To honor the king, La Salle named the region Louisiana.<br />

        <p data-uuid="53d6917104824dcdbdb12a6b0114f8c4">Starting in the 1700s, the French built new outposts. These included Detroit on the Great Lakes and Saint Louis and New Orleans along the Mississippi River. Most towns in the French territory were small. As late as 1688 there were only about 12,000 French settlers in New France. Its small population and the value of the fur trade led French settlers to ally and trade with local Native American groups.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0f87b2d2e42a4f00a82fd4c4888e1fbb"> Because of their close trading relationships, the French treated the Native Americans with more respect than some other European settlers had done. Some Algonquins allied with French settlers against English settlers and the Iroquois. In turn, many French settlers learned Native American languages and even adopted their ways of life.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="8ed335a2495a4581860114ef1675154f">Dutch Presence in the New World</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b18355d85122488292e539f55567b0bb">The English and the French were not the only European powers to seek an empire in North America. The Dutch, who had merchant fleets around the world, came in search of trade. They claimed the land between the Delaware and Hudson rivers and called it New Netherland. This area included parts of what is now New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Delaware. </p>
        <p data-uuid="010bdc1e8ee94d64a9c846e75a29768d">Dutch explorers and settlers encountered the Mahican, or Mohican, peoples, farmers who lived in large settlements of longhouses. At the center of the Mahican lands was the Hudson River. Conflicts with Dutch and other settlers pushed the Mahican eastward.</p>
        <p data-uuid="249fac1c9a8346978b78405190a801de"> In 1624 the newly formed Dutch West India Company sent about 30 families to settle in New Netherland. Two years later Peter Minuit bought Manhattan Island from local Native Americans. He paid with goods that today would be worth less than $1,100. Minuit then founded the town of New Amsterdam, today called New York City. To attract colonists, the Dutch allowed members of all religions to settle in their colony.<br />

        <p data-uuid="18e2566be5bc4bccb4e82c14a6f488fa">Minuit also helped Swedish settlers found New Sweden along the Delaware River. The first settlement, Fort Christina, was begun in 1638. The Swedish settlement was small, but the Dutch felt that it threatened Dutch lands and fur trading. The two sides fought a series of battles. Finally, the governor of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant (STY-vuh-suhnt), conquered New Sweden in 1655. He allowed the Swedes to continue their colony, but he called it the “Swedish Nation.”</p>
