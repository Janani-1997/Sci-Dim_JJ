        <p data-uuid="55c214a90af04eafb138df8d9204a167"><b><dfn title="Hamilton, Alexander">Alexander Hamilton</dfn></b> seemed born with a head
            for economics. While still in his teens, he helped run a shipping company in
            his native British West Indies. Family friends then sent him to the American
            colonies for an education. Hamilton eventually married into a wealthy New York
            family and began practicing law. He served as Washington’s aide and as a
            delegate to four Continental Congresses.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="0e3388eac3564548babca105c5d135d2">National Debt</h3>
        <p data-uuid="e1c1aa45dc954dffaaea31cc50bbaab5">As secretary of the
            treasury, Hamilton’s biggest challenge was paying off the <b><dfn title="national debt">national debt</dfn></b>—money owed by the
            United States—from the Revolutionary War. The United States owed about $11.7
            million to foreign countries and about $40.4 million to U.S. citizens. During the
            war the government raised money with bonds. <b><dfn title="bond">Bonds</dfn></b> are
            certificates of debt that carry a promise to buy back the bonds at a higher
            price. The new government could not afford to keep this promise. Bondholders
            who needed money sold their bonds for less than the original value to <b><dfn title="speculator">speculators</dfn></b>, or people who buy
            items at low prices in the hope that the value will rise and they can sell the
            items for a profit.</p>
        <p data-uuid="331c3ecc7e9943eebe28f5a22f27b808">Hamilton wanted to pay the foreign debt immediately and gradually repay the
            total value of all bonds. The second part of his plan caused disagreements
            because paying full value would allow speculators to make a profit. Hamilton
            thought this
            was fair. He said, “He [the speculator] paid what the commodity [bond] was
            worth . . . and took the risks.” </p>
        <p data-uuid="5215636acaef42f2a0437b92e9878a85"><b><dfn title="Jefferson, Thomas">Thomas Jefferson</dfn></b> disagreed. He thought the idea cheated bondholders who
            had sold their bonds at low prices. Jefferson wrote, “Immense sums were thus
            filched [stolen] from the poor and ignorant.” But more politicians agreed with
            Hamilton. In 1790 the government exchanged old bonds for new, more reliable
            ones that were guaranteed.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="0d82d990a6b243faae5e748a63426573">States’
            Debts</h3>
        <p data-uuid="e44d3249ac8848ee835b3a555d6c7c35">The states owed $25
            million for Revolutionary War expenses. Hamilton wanted the federal government
            to pay for $21.5 million of this debt. Hamilton believed that this action would
            help the federal government. He thought that paying the states’ debts would
            help the national economy. Debtor states would not have to spend so much on repayment
            and would have money to develop business and trade. Increased business and
            trade would put more money back into the national economy.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f80de4bf5a854f5f85170dbf95d65776">The South, however, did
            not want to help the federal government pay the debts of other states. States
            such as Virginia and North Carolina did not have many war debts. They thought
            Hamilton’s idea was unfair. Patrick Henry said he did not believe that the
            Constitution gave Congress the power to pay state debts. Hamilton knew that he
            needed the help of southern representatives to get his plan approved.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a4ac2483073c4108bf516b7e7fb5e4a0">Moving the Capital</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c3ee2e66a72d43659702378c1c6929f6">Hamilton
            also knew that he had something to bargain with. Officials from the southern
            states wanted to change the location of the nation’s capital. Many southerners
            thought that having the capital in New York gave the northern states too much
            influence over national policy. Hamilton, Jefferson, and James Madison met in
            June 1790. Hamilton promised to convince northern members of Congress to move
            the capital. Jefferson and Madison then agreed to gather support in the South
            for Hamilton’s debt plan.</p>
        <p data-uuid="58a2ecb6aabf4da281a10508db3d3067">The compromise worked. The national capital was
            moved to Philadelphia in 1791 for ten years. For the capital’s permanent
            location, Washington chose a place on the Potomac River that included part of
            both Maryland and Virginia. The land was made up of swamps and farms. This site
            would eventually become the city of Washington, DC.</p>
