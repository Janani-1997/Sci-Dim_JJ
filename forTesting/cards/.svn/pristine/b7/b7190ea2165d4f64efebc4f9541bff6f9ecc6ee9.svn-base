        <p data-uuid="8189523b8ff34afc9f89836e9e31170d">What the steamboat did for water travel, the train did for overland travel. Steam-powered trains had first been developed in Great Britain in the early 1800s. However, they did not become popular in the United States until the 1830s. In 1830 <b><dfn title="Cooper, Peter">Peter Cooper</dfn></b> built a small but powerful locomotive called the <i>Tom Thumb</i>. He raced the locomotive against a horse-drawn railcar. </p>

            <img alt="This painting shows a close-up of the lead car of the Tom Thumb, a locomotive that took part in a famous race against a horse. The photo shows the men driving the train and a great plume of smoke coming out of the engine.

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="2b276e3bae5e4481b40cbd2c214ca5d0">The <i>Tom Thumb</i> was made famous in a race against a horse-drawn carriage. The locomotive was small, but powerful for its day. The earliest locomotives only traveled about ten miles per hour.</p>

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="b8d7dd4dab1544ff9f0b1b8653c2d516">Eyewitness John Latrobe later described the race, in which <i>Tom Thumb</i> had a slow start and fell behind. Latrobe wrote, “The pace increased, the passengers shouted, the engine gained on the horse . . . then the engine passes the horse, and a great hurrah hailed the victory.” Unfortunately for Cooper, victory was spoiled when <i>Tom Thumb</i> broke down and lost the race near the end.</p>
        <p data-uuid="787ca0e9974a4123921f7a4d1ad12671">Despite the defeat, the contest showed the power and speed of even a small locomotive. Railroad fever soon spread. By 1840 railroad companies had laid about 2,800 miles of tracks—more than existed in all of Europe. French economist Michel Chevalier described Americans as having “a&#173;perfect passion for railroads.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="de664c36355744318b8733e5014d7726">As more railroads were built, engineers and mechanics overcame many tough challenges. Most British railroads, for example, ran on straight tracks across flat ground. In the United States, however, many railroads had to run up and down steep mountains, around tight curves, and over swift rivers. Railroad companies also built the tracks quickly and often with the least expensive materials available. As time went on, engineers and mechanics built heavier, faster, and more powerful steam locomotives.</p>

        <p data-uuid="bf1c9c34a36a4c22bbb305e56efdcece">By 1860 about 30,000 miles of tracks linked almost every major city in the eastern United States. As a result, the economy surged forward. For example, American locomotives hauled more freight than those in any other country. The railroad companies quickly became some of the most powerful businesses in the nation. As the railroad system grew, manufacturers and farmers could send their goods to distant markets.</p>
        <p data-uuid="95ee3ee46a284a98a8dd55677892ef38"> In addition to their tremendous economic impact, the railroads made a powerful impression on the senses of many passengers and observers. Trains were the fastest form of transportation that most people had ever experienced. While wagons often traveled less than 2 miles per hour, locomotives averaged about 20 miles per hour.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f04e60ec8dfb49219e17eed4e9d94b96">Riding on the early trains was often an adventure, but it could also be quite dangerous. Engineers trying to stay on time sometimes traveled too fast. English citizen Charles Richard Weld was on a railroad car that flew off the tracks. To his amazement, the other passengers did not complain about the accident. Instead, they praised the engineer for trying to keep on schedule!</p>

            <p data-uuid="ec86ead7341240e5957af2d8c0d5f23f">Passengers accepted such risks because the railroads reduced travel time dramatically. The development of the railroads changed people’s perceptions of distance. What was once considered to be a long distance to travel suddenly became just a short train ride away. Railroads also helped tie communities together. In 1847 Senator Daniel Webster spoke for many people in the United States when he declared that the railroad “towers above all other inventions of this or the preceding age.”</p>
