        <p data-uuid="d290ab8b95404d6db957fb4c333d2c87">Three main factors led to a shortage of labor in the United States during the war. First, American factories were working nonstop to produce weapons and supplies for the Allied forces. Factories needed new workers to meet this huge demand. Second, the war almost completely cut off immigration. As you know, immigrants had provided a steady source of labor to American industry. And third, many of the young men who would normally take factory jobs were off fighting in Europe.</p>

        <p data-uuid="134bc0ae1abd41628923c23de78ec4c6">This labor shortage created new opportunities for many workers. American women took on new roles to help the war effort. Some 1 million women joined the U.S. work force during the war years. Women replaced male workers in steel mills, ammunition factories, and assembly lines. Women served as street car conductors and elevator operators. For many, this was their first experience working outside the home.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0d1a5278337f46619ea4b97024620fbf"> Women also worked for the war effort in Europe. About 25,000 American women worked as nurses, telephone operators, signalers, typists, and interpreters in France. Many women worked as volunteers, serving at Red Cross facilities, encouraging the sale of bonds, and planting of victory gardens. Women were not given jobs in combat, but they braved gunfire at the front lines as nurses and ambulance drivers.<br />

        <p data-uuid="cd83768216544e4aa1ce1f4b2b68078b">Other women, meanwhile, spoke out against U.S. participation in the war. Social reformer Jane Addams was against U.S. entry into the war. Jeannette Rankin of Montana, the first female member of Congress, was 1 of 50 House members to cast a vote against declaring war in 1917. “I want to stand by my country,” she said, “but I cannot vote for war.”<br />

        <p data-uuid="516fcd52cf6547d5907ef7bdd27f98ec">Because labor was scarce, workers were in a good position to demand better wages and conditions. Union membership increased. More than 4 million unionized workers went on strike during the war. Because factory owners could not easily replace workers, they often agreed to demands.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9b357e32b54947ce8173b211d09fafc0"> President Wilson set up the <b><dfn title="National War Labor Board">National War Labor Board</dfn></b> in April 1918. The board helped workers and management avoid strikes and reach agreements. The board settled more than 1,000 labor disputes. Its members were generally sympathetic to workers. They helped establish a minimum wage and limited work hours. They also required fair pay for women.<br />

        <p data-uuid="b209b7d1c632405b9b699633e4a777aa">Many Americans had been in favor of the U.S. position of neutrality. Now, Americans had to be convinced that it was their duty to support the war. A nationwide campaign of propaganda, or posters, newspaper stories, speeches, and other materials, was started to influence people’s opinions. Popular movie stars were hired to speak on behalf of the war effort. Artists were hired to create patriotic posters and pamphlets. Propaganda helped build American support for the war.<br />
