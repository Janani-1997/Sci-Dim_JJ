        <p data-uuid="fcafa17222564b7081733399041b6e8d">The earliest people in North America were hunter-&#173;gatherers.
            After 5000 BC some of these people learned how to farm and settled in villages.
            In time, many diverse and complex societies developed throughout North America.
            Although they left no written record, historians have learned about them by studying
            artifacts, or the objects that they made and used.<br />

        <p data-uuid="6ede6dc0ae95455a9453f1fcdc1cc969">By 1500 BC the
            people who lived in the North American Southwest, like those who lived in
            Mesoamerica, were growing maize. One of the early farm cultures in the
            Southwest was the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The Anasazi lived in the Four
            Corners region, where present-day Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet.
            Anasazi farmers adapted to their dry environment and grew maize, beans, and
            squash. Over time, they began to use irrigation to increase food production. By
            the time the Anasazi settled in the area, they were already skilled basket
            makers. They wove straw, vines, and yucca to make containers for food and other
            items, and they eventually became skilled potters as well.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ca73b3a0d3064e10ad7768de7e20d7d1">
            The
            early Anasazi lived in pit houses dug into the ground. After about AD 750 they
            built <b><dfn title="pueblos">pueblos</dfn></b>, or aboveground
            houses made of a heavy clay called adobe. The Anasazi built these houses on top
            of each other, creating large multistoried complexes.</p>

                    Anasazi built their homes into cliffs for safety. Ladders often were needed to

        <p data-uuid="9aef00e6978849b0bf18037f39fe0084">Some
            pueblos had several hundred rooms and could house 1,000 people. The Anasazi
            often built their houses in canyon walls and had to use ladders to enter their
            homes. These cliff dwellings provided a strong defense against enemies. The
            Anasazi also built <b><dfn title="kivas">kivas</dfn></b>,
            underground ceremonial chambers, at the center of each community. Kivas were
            sacred areas used for religious ceremonies. Some of these rituals focused on
            the life-giving forces of rain and maize.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="8f5d411b25dc4b2e88e2d6cf07992a52">The Anasazi thrived for hundreds of years.
            After AD 1300, however, they began to abandon their villages. Scholars believe
            that drought, disease, or raids by nomadic groups from the north may have
            caused the Anasazi to move away from their pueblos.</p>

        <p data-uuid="9326634aa6c549b98d66f33400225df6">Several
            farming societies developed in the eastern part of North America after 1000 BC.
            The Hopewell lived along the Mississippi, Ohio, and lower Missouri river
            valleys. They supported their large population with agriculture and trade. They
            built large burial mounds to honor their dead. </p>
        <p data-uuid="b02149e192db49418e8ed3471834b92e">
            By
            AD 700 the Hopewell culture had declined and another culture, the
            Mississippian, began to thrive in the same area. Skilled farmers and traders,
            the Mississippian built large settlements. Their largest city, Cahokia, was located
            near present-day St. Louis, Missouri. It had a population of&#160;30,000.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f25f875ea901400480d56f4bb0e3aeef">The Mississippian people built hundreds of
            mounds for religious ceremonies. Cahokia alone had more than 100 temple and
            burial mounds. These mounds had flat tops, and temples were built on top of the
            mounds. Many of the mounds were gigantic. Monks Mound, near Collinsville,
            Illinois, for example, was 100 feet high and covered 16 acres.</p>

            Several
            other mound-building cultures thrived in eastern North America. More than
            10,000 mounds have been found in the Ohio River valley alone. Some of these
            mounds are shaped like birds and snakes. The mound-building cultures had
            declined by the time European explorers reached the Southeast. Their societies
            no longer existed by the early 1700s.</p>
