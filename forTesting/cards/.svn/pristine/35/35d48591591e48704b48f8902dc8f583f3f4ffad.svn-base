        <p data-uuid="d7d991f8a64c42b5b6b068a5d3a12e3f">Publications about women’s rights first appeared in the United States shortly after the American Revolution. However, women’s concerns did not become a national issue with strong opposition for many more years.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="da6d53729d5542d693e23712daf144ee">The Movement Grows</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f794502958e4490394925f169e64cc1c">The change took place when women took a more active and leading role in reform and abolition. Other social changes also led to the rise of the women’s movement. Women took advantage of better educational opportunities in the early 1800s. Their efforts on behalf of reform groups helped them learn how to organize more effectively and to work together.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3760422ba2534e56a41c19851fd1e4d3">Another benefit of reform-group work was that some men began to fight for women’s rights. Many activists, both men and women, found it unacceptable that women were denied the democratic right to vote or sit on juries. They were also upset that married women in many states had little or no control over their own property.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="906fdd7b673c431c9c56fb7ebf06c997">Opposition to Women’s Rights</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3cc21099e11a4bb6a1960e56e249ff51">Like the abolitionist movement, the struggle for women’s rights faced opposition. Many people did not agree with some of the goals of the women’s rights movement. Some women believed that they did not need new rights. They said that women were not unequal to men, only different. Some critics believed that women should not try to work in public for social changes. Women were welcome to work for social change, but only from within their homes.<br />

        <p data-uuid="68f29bd836b74c439a4e2b5eb176a7f9">Some people also thought that women lacked the physical or mental strength to survive without men’s protection. They believed that a woman should go from the protection of her father’s home to that of her husband’s. They also thought that women could not cope with the outside world; therefore, a husband should control his wife’s property. Despite opposition, women continued to pursue their goal of greater rights.</p>
