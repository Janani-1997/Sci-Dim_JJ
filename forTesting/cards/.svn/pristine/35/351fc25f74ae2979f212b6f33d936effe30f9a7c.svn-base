They expressed support for the creation of an international peacekeeping organization. They also agreed that nations freed from Germany should have the right “to create democratic institutions of their own choice.” Stalin promised to allow free elections in the Soviet-occupied countries in Eastern Europe. However, after driving German troops out of Poland, Soviet forces set up a pro-Soviet Communist government.</p>

The Allied leaders divided conquered Germany into four zones. Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union would each occupy one zone. The capital city of Berlin—located deep inside the Soviet zone—was also divided into four zones.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6d9830b1c48f4b9d9559550378b79c42"> After World War II, Allied leaders formed a special court, called the International Military Tribunal, to try Axis leaders accused of war crimes. In November 1945 the tribunal put high-ranking Nazis on trial in the German city of Nuremberg in what became known as the Nuremberg trials. U.S. Supreme Court justice Robert H. Jackson served as the chief American attorney. In his opening statement, Jackson explained the importance of the trials.<br />

        <p data-uuid="368a68048ed04998b834ee70ad539f11">The court charged Nazi officials with crimes against humanity. One defendant was Hermann Goering, a key planner of Hitler’s “final solution.” Another was Hans Frank, Poland’s wartime governor, who had organized the killing of hundreds of thousands of Poles and Polish Jews. The tribunal found 19 Nazi leaders guilty. Of these, 12 leaders, including Goering and Frank, were sentenced to death.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9864278101ce446fadfba359062dcec4">The International Military Tribunal for the Far East held trials in Japan. Japan’s wartime leader Hideki Tojo was convicted and executed. Seven other Japanese leaders were also sentenced to death. The trials in Germany and Japan helped establish the principle that individuals must be held responsible for committing war crimes, even when acting on behalf of a government.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e5dd9dd712044963a0216bfae50eed72">During the war, President Roosevelt had spoken of the need for a new international organization to promote world peace. Roosevelt did not believe the United States alone could bring peace to the whole world. “The structure of world peace,” he said, “must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="28a862496ec64b0d8fd52ee0b7bd5470">In 1944 American, British, Soviet, and Chinese representatives met to draft a plan for the <dfn title="United Nation (UN)">United Nations<b> </b>(UN)</dfn>—an organization dedicated to resolving international conflicts. In 1945 representatives from 50 countries met to write the United Nations Charter. The UN Charter declared the organization’s commitment “to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security.” President Truman appointed Eleanor Roosevelt as one of the first U.S. delegates to the UN.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cccd2f8bb44b4bc99ccd942bc601dce7"> At the UN, Eleanor Roosevelt helped write and advocate for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the UN adopted in 1948. During Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency, she had changed the role of First Lady by holding her own press conferences, making speeches, and writing newspaper columns that actively promoted human rights, children’s welfare, and equal rights for women and minorities.<br />

        <p data-uuid="0862cbb2587341e9adb262e641e01981">One of the UN’s first actions concerned Palestine, occupied by the British after World War I. The UN General Assembly voted to divide the area into separate Arab and Jewish states. Jews had begun moving to Palestine, an area important to the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religions, after World War I. Many more moved there before and during World War II. On May 14, 1948, Jewish leaders announced the creation of the nation of Israel.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8b3d0bbf9c2e4f309f67eda068c6d514"> The United States quickly recognized the new Jewish state. Arab leaders refused to do so and claimed the land as their own. Armies from five Arab states attacked Israel. Israeli forces drove them back, and the two sides reached a truce in 1949. Israel then joined the UN. But tensions remained high.<br />
