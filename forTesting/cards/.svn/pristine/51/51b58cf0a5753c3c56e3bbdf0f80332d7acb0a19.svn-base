        <p data-uuid="19174ffcc78542b983554f7b776b4869">Both sides expected the war to be over in a few months. German leaders planned to defeat France quickly, before Russia could join the fighting. But as the Germans marched toward France, they met fierce resistance from Belgian soldiers. This gave Britain and France time to mobilize their own troops. New military technologies changed military strategy and resulted in an unprecedented number of casualties.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="18ee00c48ce14cf8933b4965732b6457">The First Battle of the Marne</h3>
        <p data-uuid="67924475ca8b4bb19e3c6913dc9d74fd">Belgian resistance slowed the German advance but could not stop it. On September 3 the German army was just 25 miles from Paris, the capital of France. The French army blocked the German advance at the Marne River, east of Paris. The First Battle of the Marne raged for several days before the Germans were pushed back.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dab11d6f76214b639fe694918461cbbc"> By mid-September French and German troops faced each other along a long battle line called the western front. The western front stretched from the North Sea all the way to Switzerland. Meanwhile, the Russian and German armies were struggling back and forth along the eastern front. The eastern front reached from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. It quickly became clear that this war would be longer and deadlier than anyone had expected.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="1c1cac20b6054bc59fff34778710d57d">A New Kind of War</h3>
        <p data-uuid="49539d96bd07470bbc72c19659187be7">Part of what made World War I so long and deadly was a new technique called <b><dfn title="trench warfare">trench warfare</dfn></b>. In trench warfare, soldiers defended a position by fighting from the protection of deep ditches. When the French defeated the Germans in the First Battle of the Marne, the Germans did not retreat far. Instead, they dug trenches nearby. Opposite them, the French dug their own trenches. A 400-mile-long network of trenches soon stretched across the western front.<br />

        <p data-uuid="ad696c3f193f4e959a874f65a389f121">The empty patch of ground between enemy trenches came to be known as “no-man’s-land.” This area was quickly stripped of trees and blasted full of holes by artillery shells. Anyone who ventured into no-man’s-land was likely to be killed by enemy fire.</p>
        <p data-uuid="3e10b1690e9947b09b9bbeb127fa0bec"> Another factor that made World War I deadlier than previous wars was the use of modern technology. New machine guns, for example, could fire 400 to 600 bullets a minute. Enormous artillery guns fired shells over the trenches. The shells exploded and sent speeding scraps of metal onto the soldiers below. Other shells spread poisonous gases. If soldiers were not wearing gas masks, the gas destroyed their lungs, causing slow, painful deaths. Poisonous gases were originally banned but came back into use by both sides by the end of the war. This was called chemical warfare.<br />

        <p data-uuid="774288fb58194f5384ee041d7b80e367">Other new weapons included tanks and aircraft, including airplanes. Tanks are armored combat vehicles that can cause heavy damage but cannot be destroyed easily. Airplanes were used to fire down on soldiers in trenches and to gather information about enemy locations. Airplanes also battled each other in fights called “dogfights.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="97e325fb2768438588067f91fead2965">After a year of vicious fighting, the war had become a <b><dfn title="stalemate">stalemate</dfn></b>—a situation in which neither side can win a decisive victory. Determined to break the stalemate, both sides launched massive attacks in 1916. In February 1916 the Germans attacked the French city of Verdun, at the southern end of the western front. That summer, the Allies staged an attack along the Somme River, in northeastern France. Both battles raged for months, as the armies attacked and counterattacked.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bb16e44557ca4655a0bac8e47677ac35">By the end of the year, the Germans had failed to take Verdun. At the Somme River, the Allies had advanced just seven miles. Almost nothing had changed on the western front. But nearly 1 million men had been killed at Verdun and the Somme River.</p>
        <p data-uuid="72f427c0b2b64be39d18f7203b0b9cee"> As the stalemate on land dragged on, sea battles in the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea became even more important. The powerful British navy blockaded the ports of the Central powers. They also laid explosive mines in the North Sea. These could blow a huge hole in a ship, sinking it in minutes. The tactic effectively stopped ships from reaching German ports with needed supplies.<br />
