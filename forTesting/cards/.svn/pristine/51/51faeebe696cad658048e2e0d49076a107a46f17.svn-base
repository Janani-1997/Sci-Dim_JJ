        <p data-uuid="5fd0ecd7473549e4b5fb581c7dedb446">The United States was still experiencing the
            effects of the Great Depression when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in
            December 1941. The enormous effort of mobilizing for war finally brought the
            Depression to an end. The economy was converted to war production. Factories
            ran 24 hours a day, producing ships, tanks, jeeps, guns, and ammunition.
            Americans turned their knowledge of mass production toward the production of
            war supplies. One remarkable example was the building of Liberty
            ships—transport vessels for troops and supplies. Workers could build an entire
            441-foot-long Liberty ship in as little as four days.</p>
        <p data-uuid="431148b2751b448faab7348e3a1eae1b">
            American workers were soon doubling the war
            production of Germany, Japan, and all other Axis Power countries combined.
            Unemployment fell to 1 percent in 1944. Agricultural production increased as
            well, as farmers sent food overseas to feed Allied soldiers. On the home front,
            one could buy only limited amounts of many foods, from coffee to canned goods.
            To organize the war effort, the government created the <b><dfn title="War Production Board">War Production Board</dfn></b> (WPB) to oversee the conversion of
            factories to war production. In 1942, for example, the WPB banned the
            production of cars so that auto plants could produce military equipment.
            Essential resources, such as rubber for tires and gasoline, were rationed to
            ensure adequate supplies for military use.<br />

        <p data-uuid="93594812cbd84c2e9abffb3dfa8ed9fb">The United States also needed millions of
            soldiers. Congress had begun to prepare for war by passing the Selective
            Training and Service Act in 1940. This was the first peacetime draft in the
            country’s history. Men from the ages of 21 to 35 (later 18 to 38) were required
            to register for the draft. More than 16 million Americans served during the
            war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0f175d04798e4f04ba81702aa2236482">To finance the war effort, the government
            increased taxes and sold war bonds. War bonds were essentially loans that
            people made to the government. People who bought war bonds in 1942, for
            example, would get their money back ten years later, with interest.</p>

            Americans also contributed to the war effort by
            collecting scrap metal that could be used in weapons factories. People learned
            to adjust to government rations limiting the supply of gasoline, rubber, shoes,
            and some foods. Posters urged Americans to “Use it up, wear it out, make it do,
            or do without.”<br />
