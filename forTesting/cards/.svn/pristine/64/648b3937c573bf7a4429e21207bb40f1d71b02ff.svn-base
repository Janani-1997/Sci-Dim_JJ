        <p data-uuid="beb040c373ed40c2b2fb885e4fb06fac">One important duty is to obey laws and respect the authorities who enforce them. Obeying laws includes knowing what they are and staying informed about any changes to the law. Ignorance of a law will not prevent a person from being punished for breaking it.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6fc0c7ce83de45ae81a4661bc736db61">Another duty is paying taxes for services such as public roads, police, and public schools. People pay sales taxes, property taxes, and tariffs. Many Americans also pay a tax on their income to the federal, and sometimes state, government.</p>
        <p data-uuid="904043f3999e46568e97eed473a28ed6">Citizens may also have the duty to defend the nation. Men 18 years or older must register with selective service. In the event of a <b><dfn title="draft">draft</dfn></b>, or required military service, those able to fight are already registered. Although women do not register, many serve in the armed forces.</p>
        <p data-uuid="170a0c4e758a467e823ca7644545cadd"> Americans have the right to a trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment. To protect this right, citizens should be willing to serve on a jury when they are called. Otherwise, fulfilling each person’s Sixth Amendment rights would be difficult.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="47f13bac5f9048c79354d7f541903abc">Civic Responsibilities</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f5a1683b21ff4cf7a8cab19d3527e8e9">In addition to duties, which are required by law, citizens also have responsibilities to fulfill. Although voluntary, these responsibilities are necessary for American democracy to work. As Texas congresswoman Barbara Jordan once said, “The stakes . . . are too high for government to be a spectator sport.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="c2c48f44f7e643ce9aa08181ab024c16"> The most important civic responsibility is voting. Representatives respond to the opinions of the voters who elect them. If only a small portion of constituents vote, the policies of a representative may not reflect the true opinions of the people he or she represents.</p>

However, officials in southern states often prevented them from voting through violence and legal discrimination. On March 15, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson made a speech to Congress calling for a new law to protect the voting rights of African Americans. He signed the Voting Rights Act a few months later. </p>

        <p data-uuid="a4f6ddbd6ae34f16a772b55fff0d8bb4">Voting is closely tied to participation in political parties, because people often vote for the candidate of their own party. A majority of Americans are members of either the Democratic or the Republican party. Others belong to smaller parties or consider themselves to be independent voters. The U.S. government has generally been dominated by two major parties, but smaller parties focused on single issues may influence public opinion. Citizens can support political parties through donations or by working on election campaigns.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="0b68ed6f49464d1fba027d97c0f41591"> To make the best choices in voting, people have a responsibility to stay informed on public issues and candidates. Information is available from many sources: the Internet, newspapers, television, other media, and from attending public meetings or listening to speeches. However, voters should also be aware that some material may be deliberately biased to help or harm a particular candidate or cause. Comparing many sources of information and opinions can help voters make decisions that reflect their interests.</p>
