        <p data-uuid="e9b7995ec2a6441984faf89417882ef5">The violence of the Ku Klux Klan was not the only challenge to Reconstruction. Republicans slowly lost control of southern state governments to the Democratic Party. The General Amnesty Act of 1872 allowed former Confederates, except those who had held high ranks, to serve in public office. Many of these former Confederates, most of whom were Democrats, were soon elected to southern governments.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cf95ee5591fc48838a43bdc45da873fe">The Republican Party also began losing its power in the North. Although President Grant was re-elected in 1872, financial and political scandals in his administration upset voters. In his first term, a gold-buying scheme involving Grant’s cousin led to a brief crisis on the stock market called Black Friday. During his second term, his personal secretary was involved in the Whiskey Ring scandal, in which whiskey distillers and public officials worked together to steal liquor taxes from the federal government. Also, people blamed Republican policies for the Panic of 1873.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="826d6625ccc4443a82118a0f542d954e">Panic of 1873</h3>
        <p data-uuid="2dfeb5261450421fbb8495001bd4a3d0">This severe economic downturn began in September 1873 when Jay Cooke and Company, a major investor in railroads and the largest financier of the Union’s Civil War effort, declared bankruptcy. The company had lied about the value of land along the side of the Northern Pacific Railroad that it owned and was trying to sell. When the truth leaked out, the company failed.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0801bd15a35644e7abed562091a49210"> The failure of such an important business sent panic through the stock market, and investors began selling shares of stock more rapidly than people wanted to buy them. Soon, 89 of the nation’s 364 railroads had failed as well. The failure of almost 18,000 other businesses followed within two years. By 1876 unemployment had risen to 14 percent, with an estimated two million people out of work. The high unemployment rate set off numerous strikes and protests, many involving railroad workers.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="1a0ae6a2aaf84f93a624df31e782f062">Election of 1876</h3>
        <p data-uuid="50e680e6dffd4577a8fe20039cd17319">Republicans could tell that northern support for Reconstruction was fading. Voters’ attention was shifting to economic problems. In 1874 the Republican Party lost control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats. The Republicans in Congress managed to pass one last civil rights law. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 guaranteed African Americans equal rights in public places, such as theaters and public transportation. But as Americans became increasingly worried about economic problems and government corruption, the Republican Party began to abandon Reconstruction.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e0d5e43bc5a04097b412e169eadfd509">Republicans selected Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes as their 1876 presidential candidate. He believed in ending federal support of the Reconstruction governments. The Democrats nominated New York governor Samuel J. Tilden. During the election, Democrats in the South again used violence at the polls to keep Republican voters away.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2c49f7314c694b5eb6d7cdad3e2114a3"> The election between Hayes and Tilden was close. Tilden appeared to have won. Republicans challenged the electoral votes in Oregon and three southern states. A special commission of members of Congress and Supreme Court justices was appointed to settle the issue.</p>

        <p data-uuid="47b18f7fd8b8456aafddaa8b543fc816">The commission narrowly decided to give all the disputed votes to Hayes. Hayes thus won the presidency by one electoral vote. In the <b><dfn title="Compromise of 1877">Compromise of 1877</dfn></b>, the Democrats agreed to accept Hayes’s victory. In return, they wanted all remaining federal troops removed from the South. They also asked for funding for internal improvements in the South and the appointment of a southern Democrat to the president’s cabinet. Shortly after he took office in 1877, President Hayes removed the last of the federal troops from the South.</p>

        <p data-uuid="d941f83d06b34ffebf20fc036a458ec8">Gradually, Democrats regained control of state governments in the South. In each state, they moved quickly to get rid of the Reconstruction reforms.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f8f4511a3f0b460aa3b4cafbc32d6e57">Democrats who brought their party back to power in the South were called Redeemers. They came from a variety of backgrounds. For instance, U.S. senator John T. Morgan of Alabama was a former general in the Confederate army. Newspaper editor Henry Grady of Georgia was interested in promoting southern industry.</p>
        <p data-uuid="482e1825b6ee4d5aa571bf9ddd04103e">Redeemers wanted to reduce the size of state government and limit the rights of African Americans. They lowered state budgets and got rid of a variety of social programs. The Redeemers cut property taxes and cut public funding for schools. They also succeeded in limiting African Americans’ civil rights.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="4f5951900e0a416ab53b7a6b8f18d954"> African Americans’ Rights Restricted</h3>
        <p data-uuid="f4e559ad2dd44de1945ce05e36d090a1">Redeemers set up the poll tax in an effort to deny the vote to African Americans. The <b><dfn title="poll tax">poll tax</dfn></b> was a special tax people had to pay before they could vote.</p>
        <p data-uuid="18f4c8ade53841b18cf768c0d285c767">Some states also targeted African American voters by requiring them to pass a literacy test. A so-called grandfather clause written into law affected men whose fathers or grandfathers could vote before 1867. In those cases, a voter did not have to pay a poll tax or pass a literacy test. As a result, almost every white man could escape the voting restrictions.</p>

The Court also ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to the actions of state governments. This ruling allowed private individuals and businesses to practice segregation.</p>

        <p data-uuid="5c6a0f9fa21d4208bd472cf807ca9978">Plessy sued the railroad company and lost. His lawyers argued that the law violated his right to equal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment. He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled against Plessy in <dfn title="Plessy v. Ferguson"><i>Plessy</i> <i></i>v. <i>Ferguson</i></dfn>. Segregation was allowed, said the Court, if “separate-but-equal” facilities were provided. Among the justices, only John Marshall Harlan disagreed with the Court’s decision.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4379fd35faba475bb6aacc81c3b0e0ac">Segregation became widespread across the country. African Americans were forced to use separate public schools, libraries, and parks. When they existed, these facilities were usually of poorer quality than those created for whites. In practice, these so-called separate-but-equal facilities were separate and unequal. Neither Congress nor the president would make significant actions to overturn the doctrine until the 1900s.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="64ae64a92de149159ac983397f4ad451">Farming in the South</h3>
        <p data-uuid="16dfeebd2ee04919963ecf2e5b101473">Few African Americans in the South could afford to buy or even rent farms. Many African Americans therefore remained on plantations. Others tried to make a living in the cities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4ea3b1d36e7441a697d24063cdc47114"> African Americans who stayed on plantations often became part of a system known as <b><dfn title="sharecropping">sharecropping</dfn></b>, or sharing the crop. Landowners provided the land, tools, and supplies, and sharecroppers provided the labor. At harvest time, the sharecropper usually had to give most of the crop to the landowner. Whatever remained belonged to the sharecropper. In theory, “croppers” who saved a little might even rent land for cash and keep their full harvest in a system known as tenant farming.</p>
        <p data-uuid="42fb2a00faac4739b970d7c1f72a1b37">Instead, most sharecroppers lived in a cycle of poverty. When they needed food, clothing, or supplies, most families had to buy goods on credit because they had little cash. When sharecroppers sold their crops, they hoped to be able to pay off these debts. However, bad weather, poor harvests, or low crop prices often made this dream impossible.<br />
