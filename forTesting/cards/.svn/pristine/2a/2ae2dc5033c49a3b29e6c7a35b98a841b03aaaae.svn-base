        <p data-uuid="294eac51e90348e2bcaf616e2921338d">The Hispanic population of the United States grew to 4 million by 1960 and to more than 10 million by 1970. Though people of Mexican descent made up the majority of this population, Hispanic Americans were a diverse group. Many people from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other Latin American countries also lived in the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="48979a924fc34390b3dfb80cf3784a4a"> The success of African Americans in battling segregation encouraged Hispanic Americans to fight for their own rights. <b><dfn title="Chavez, Cesar">Cesar Chavez</dfn></b> was one of many Hispanic Americans who worked to improve conditions. In 1962, with help from <b><dfn title="aaf3f860d529425c82a5ab597eb88269">Dolores Huerta</dfn></b> and Gil Padilla, Chavez formed a union. It would later become the <b><dfn title="United Farm Workers">United Farm Workers</dfn></b> (UFW). This union was committed to the goal of better pay and working conditions for migrant farmworkers—those who move seasonally from farm to farm for work. Chavez led the UFW in a five-year strike and boycott against California grape growers. Huerta worked by his side as the union’s chief negotiator for contracts. They negotiated to guarantee farmworkers fair wages, benefits, and humane working conditions. The workers finally won better wages and benefits in 1970. The UFW became a national organization in 1976.<br />

We did not choose the grape boycott, but we had chosen to leave our peonage, poverty and despair behind. Though our first bid for freedom, the strike, was weakened, we would not turn back. The boycott was the only way forward the growers left to us. We called upon our fellow men and were answered by consumers who said—as all men of conscience must—that they would no longer allow their tables to be subsidized by our sweat and our sorrow: They shunned the grapes, fruit of our affliction.</p>

Between us and the justice we seek now stand the large and powerful grocers who, in continuing to buy table grapes, betray the boycott their own customers have built. These stores treat their patrons' demands to remove the grapes the same way the growers treat our demands for union recognition—by ignoring them. The consumers who rally behind our cause are responding as we do to such treatment—with a boycott!<br />

After losing their land during the Great Depression, Chavez and his family began working as migrant farmworkers. Moving from town to town in search of work, Chavez went to more than 30 different schools. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, then returned to the fields to help migrant workers fight for better pay and working conditions. </p>
            <p data-uuid="ddc42d96372a4c50a0efa50b122be490"> The soft-spoken Chavez seemed to many an unlikely leader of a protest movement. But Chavez quickly became an influential leader, continuing to lead the struggle for farmworkers’ rights into the 1990s. Before his death, Chavez insisted, “It’s not me who counts, it’s the Movement.”</p>

        <p data-uuid="6c21ccc70d0e4a3fa307764cd750e001">Chavez helped inspire young leaders in what became known as the Chicano movement. To fight discrimination and gain greater political influence, Chicano activists formed a political party called <i>La Raza Unida</i>, or the United Race. The Hispanic civil rights movement had important consequences. A 1968 amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act required schools to teach students whose first language was not English in both languages until they learned English. The Voting Rights Act of 1975 required communities with large immigrant populations to print ballots in the voters’ preferred language.<br />
