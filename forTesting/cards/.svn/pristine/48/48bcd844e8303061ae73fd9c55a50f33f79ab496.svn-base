The messengers carried mail between relay stations on a route about 2,000 miles long. However, telegraph lines, which sent messages faster, quickly put the Pony Express out of business.</p>

        <p data-uuid="6549571d1ee94151ab5c70decdc707eb">Some Americans wanted to build a <b><dfn title="transcontinental railroad">transcontinental railroad</dfn></b>—a railroad that would cross the continent and connect the East to the West. The federal government, therefore, passed the Pacific Railway Acts in 1862 and 1864. These acts gave railroad companies loans and large land grants that could be sold to pay for construction costs. Congress had granted more than 131 million acres of public land to railroad companies. In exchange, the government asked the railroads to carry U.S. mail and troops at a lower cost. Many railroad companies were inspired to begin laying miles of tracks. </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="24a7dbf082b24ad0a1c62e6ac2398ac4">The Great Race</h3>
        <p data-uuid="433ccfc465f14198b2248b4642bfaa6f">Two companies, the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific, led the race to complete the transcontinental railroad. In February 1863 the Central Pacific began building east from Sacramento, California. At the end of the year, the Union Pacific started building west from Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
        <p data-uuid="717600f4bcba41d6918076ecc33c4a75">The Union Pacific hired thousands of railroad workers, particularly Irish immigrants. Chinese immigrants made up some 85 percent of the Central Pacific workforce. The railroad's part-owner Leland Stanford praised them, but he paid them less than other laborers. Chinese crews also were given the most dangerous tasks and had to work longer hours than other railroad laborers. They took the job, however, because the $30 a month that the Central Pacific paid was as much as 10 times what they could earn in China.<br />
        </p>
        <p data-uuid="85868c3ed9f643bcbb5542fdf5e9fb38">Railroad companies faced many geographic challenges. For example, workers for the Central Pacific struggled to cross the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. Breaking apart its rock formations required setting carefully controlled explosions using large amounts of blasting powder and the explosive nitroglycerin. And in the winter of 1866 snowdrifts more than 60 feet high trapped and killed dozens of workers. Faced with these obstacles, the Central Pacific took four years to lay the first 115 miles of track.</p>

        <p data-uuid="29456feaf14348879fd59d1d9457e64c">For both railroad companies, providing food and supplies for workers was vital. This job became more difficult in remote areas. The railroad companies consequently often relied on local resources. Professional hunters, such as William “Buffalo Bill” Cody, shot thousands of buffalo to feed Union Pacific workers.<br />

        <p data-uuid="735b64e9fbaa4b9c8d1ef2c924fc741d">The transcontinental railroad increased both economic growth and the population in the West. Railroad companies provided better transportation for people and goods. They also sold land to settlers, which encouraged people to move west.</p>
        <p data-uuid="52b36f6ccbe7433d8e45b34276c49c02">New railroads helped businesses. Western timber companies, miners, ranchers, and farmers shipped wood, metals, meat, and grain east by railroad. In exchange, eastern businesses shipped manufactured goods to the West. As trade between regions increased, the idea that the U.S. economy was interdependent became more widespread.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f3bbd25088474424aec47fdcdf2e091e">Even perceptions of time became more formal as railroad schedules began to unite areas that before had existed under different times. Before the railroads, each community determined its own time, based on calculations about the sun’s travels. This system, called “solar time,” caused problems for people who scheduled trains crossing a long distance. The railroad companies addressed the issue by setting up <b><dfn title="standard time">standard time</dfn></b>. This system divided the United States into four time zones.</p>

        <p data-uuid="42f8af3c549e42a790edd843a384dc6b">Railroad companies encouraged people to put their money into the railroad business, which they did—sometimes unwisely. Railroad speculation and the collapse of railroad owner Jay Cooke's banking firm helped start the Panic of 1873. By the 1880s many small western railroads were deeply in debt. Despite such setbacks, Americans remained interested in railroad investments. By 1890 there were about 164,000 more miles of track in operation than in 1865. Railroads had one of the biggest industries in the United States.</p>
