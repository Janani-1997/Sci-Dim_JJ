        <p data-uuid="bd1f4ca8c4424db09f36853e44299d8b">Young, fresh recruits in both armies were generally eager to fight. Experienced troops, however, knew better.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="c1ec85946d88474786916b0c1c12d0b4">On the Battlefield</h3>
        <p data-uuid="5b87e140435b4f33a7b870c58b0f8637">Civil War armies fought in the ancient battlefield formation that produced massive casualties. Endless rows of troops fired directly at one another, with cannonballs landing amid them. When the order was given, soldiers would attach bayonets to their guns and rush toward their enemy. Men died to gain every inch of ground.</p>
        <p data-uuid="40c36677c17846e5bd4ff446c32ccb99">Doctors and nurses in the field saved many lives. Yet they had no medicines to stop infections that developed after soldiers were wounded. Many soldiers endured the horror of having infected legs and arms amputated without painkillers. Infections from minor injuries caused many deaths.</p>
        <p data-uuid="802e86f0f6074e7f98c9de6c632cd446">Despite the huge battlefield losses, the biggest killer in the Civil War was not the fighting. It was diseases such as typhoid, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Nearly twice as many soldiers died of illnesses and disease as died in combat.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="15d579e0cecf404883dd0e9cb39e91fc">Prisoners of War</h3>
        <p data-uuid="32e6471ec38f40518515b4b7b74d35d2"> As hard as army life was, conditions for prisoners of war were much worse. At first, neither North nor South kept large numbers of captured soldiers. Many prisoners were released if they promised to go home instead of back to their army. Others were exchanged for prisoners held by the other side. Military prisoners on both sides lived in unimaginable misery. In prison camps, such as Andersonville, Georgia, and Elmira, New York, soldiers were packed into camps designed to hold only a fraction of their number. Soldiers had little shelter, food, or clothing. Starvation and disease killed thousands of prisoners.</p>

        <p data-uuid="df20c5096e0c442c9991c17b1e10bc95">The war effort involved all levels of society. Women as well as people too young or too old for military service worked in factories and on farms. Economy in the North boomed as production and prices soared. The lack of workers caused wages to rise by 43 percent between 1860 and 1865.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6191bc2f3f054aa99e3479ac6bcfaebe">Women were the backbone of civilian life and took over farms, plantations, stores, and other businesses while their fathers, husbands, and sons served in armies. On the farms, women and children performed the daily chores usually done by men. One visitor to Iowa in 1862 reported that he “met more women . . . at work in the fields than men.” Southern women also managed farms and plantations.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b8a839480d2b452bacf0c8b736517194">The need for clothes, shoes, and other supplies created about 100,000 jobs for women in northern factories. Women also worked in the South’s few factories, and women on both sides performed dangerous work making ammunition for the troops.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a45b1d00ae214c82a3a80e9b0917834b"> Many women found new occupations. Hundreds were hired by the Union government as clerks. They became the first women to hold federal government jobs. Women also staffed government offices in the South. Like clerical work, nursing was a man’s job before the war. During the war, however, about 3,000 women served the Union army as paid nurses.</p>

Volunteer <b><dfn title="Barton, Clara">Clara Barton</dfn></b> organized the collection of medicine and supplies for delivery to the battlefield. At the field hospitals, the “angel of the battlefield” soothed the wounded and dying and assisted doctors as bullets flew around her. Barton’s work formed the basis for the future American Red Cross.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b997c6266a654d1b9256359b30384bdd"> In the South, Sally Louisa Tompkins established a small hospital in Richmond, Virginia. By the end of the war, it had grown into a major army hospital. Jefferson Davis recognized her value to the war effort by making her a captain in the Confederate army.<br />
