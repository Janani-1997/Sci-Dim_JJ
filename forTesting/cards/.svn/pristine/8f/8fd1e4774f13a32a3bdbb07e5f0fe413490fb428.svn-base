        <p data-uuid="7a49a03be96d455aa0cadeb68c85ad8f">After Grant became president in
            1869, the Republicans seemed stronger than ever. They controlled most southern governments,
            partly because of the support of African American voters. However, most of the
            Republican officeholders were unpopular with white southerners.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a2ae49e6915a4f07b150bfce1d056a16">Carpetbaggers and Scalawags</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b2c4f6f7e2354399811e4edd1cad9a86">Some of these officeholders were
            northern-born Republicans who had moved to the South after the war. Many white
            southerners called them carpetbaggers. Supposedly, they had rushed there carrying all their possessions in bags made from carpeting. Many southerners resented
            these northerners, accusing them—often unfairly—of trying to profit from
            Reconstruction. Because the South needed both physical and economic rebuilding,
            there were many business opportunities. Northerners who had not been devastated
            by the war had more money to invest and could therefore profit from these
            opportunities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bb18ede20b32423ab1dc7a83b8c08127">Southern
            Democrats cared even less for white southern Republicans. They referred to them
            as scalawags, or greedy rascals. Democrats believed that these southerners had
            betrayed the South by voting for the Republican Party. Many southern
            Republicans were small farmers who had supported the Union during the war.
            Others, like Mississippi governor James Alcorn, were former members of the Whig
            Party. They preferred to become Republicans rather than join the Democrats.</p>

            African
            Americans were the largest group of southern Republican voters. During
            Reconstruction, more than 600 African Americans won election to state
            legislatures. Some 16 of these politicians were elected to Congress. Other
            African Americans held local offices in counties throughout the South.</p>

            from many backgrounds. <b><dfn title="Revels, Hiram">Hiram Revels</dfn></b> was born free in North Carolina and went to college in
            Illinois. He became a Methodist minister and served as a chaplain in the Union
            army. In 1870 Revels became the first African American in the U.S. Senate. He
            took over the seat previously held by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Revels held a
            moderate view of the readmission of former Confederates. Education and
            employment for African Americans were two of his top priorities. Revels
            exemplified the ability of African Americans to take part in governing. After
            completing his term, he became the first president of Alcorn University.</p>

            Unlike
            Revels, Blanche K. Bruce grew up in slavery in Virginia. Bruce became an
            important Republican in Mississippi and served one term as a U.S. senator. He
            worked to integrate the military while in office.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e76de4a69d694e40adbaff37ccc3a5c5">The new Reconstruction state governments
            made policies that increased civil and voting rights for African Americans.
            They passed laws that ensured African Americans were allowed to vote in every
            community. In many places, however, there was still resistance by whites.
            Because former Confederates usually could not vote, they struggled to maintain
            political influence.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7584da3001b543a9b02b495927e2d2f5">Reconstruction
            governments provided money for many new programs and organizations in the
            South. They helped to establish some of the first state-funded public school
            systems in the South. They also built new hospitals, prisons, and orphanages,            and passed laws prohibiting discrimination against African Americans. Many of
            these programs improved the lives of African Americans and whites in the South
            and gave people economic opportunities and access to political offices.
            However, racism and the dramatically different culture of groups led to
            conflicting expectations, and sometimes tensions led to violence.&#160;</p>
        <p data-uuid="0c6c2cb6d8134d1ba54c55ba9d83caa3">Southern
            states under Republican control spent large amounts of money. They aided the
            construction of railroads, bridges, and public buildings. These improvements
            were intended to help the southern economy recover from the war. To get the
            money for these projects, the Reconstruction governments raised taxes and
            issued bonds. Although some people protested the increased taxes, the improved
            infrastructure helped the South to increase its trade and production
            capabilities.</p>
