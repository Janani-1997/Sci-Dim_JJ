        <p data-uuid="a53b5f204bfc4020b85e310d1458b874">Like public schools and buses, many private
            businesses in the South were segregated. In Greensboro, North Carolina, four
            students decided to challenge this form of segregation. They targeted a lunch
            counter at Woolworth, a popular department store. Black customers were supposed
            to eat standing up at one end of the counter. White customers sat down to eat
            at the other end.</p>
        <p data-uuid="cf4a484f42514b5ea628f1a46eb123f7">
            On
            February 1, 1960, the students went into Woolworth and staged a <b><dfn title="sit-in">sit-in</dfn></b>â€”a demonstration in which
            protesters sit down and refuse to leave. They sat in the whites-only section of
            the lunch counter and ordered coffee. They were not served, but they stayed
            until the store closed. The next day, they returned with dozens more students
            to continue the sit-in. Soon, another sit-in began at the lunch counter of a
            nearby store.<br />

                    this sit-in at a segregated lunch counter, young African Americans sat with
                    their white friends and asked to be served. The activists reacted calmly as
                    onlookers harassed them.</p>

        <p data-uuid="b6c6a32b174c462eb89e90738c7caca1">People across the country read newspaper
            stories about the Greensboro sit-ins. Picket lines supporting the sit-ins began
            to appear outside of Woolworth stores in northern cities. Other black students
            in North Carolina and across the South began to hold similar protests at
            segregated facilities such as libraries, restaurants, and churches. The student
            protesters practiced the strategy of nonviolent resistance. No matter how much
            they were insulted or threatened, they refused to respond with violence. They
            were inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., who was a strong supporter of
            nonviolent action.</p>
        <p data-uuid="adc00eb5a1ce4dd4952cafd3d94cefff">
            These
            social conflicts led to change in North Carolina and the rest of the United
            States. Over time, some restaurants and businesses, including Woolworth, began
            the process of integration. To continue the struggle for civil rights, the
            leaders of the student protests formed the <dfn title="Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee">Student
            Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) </dfn>in the spring of 1960. The
            SNCC activists trained protesters and organized civil rights demonstrations.
            Bob Moses, a leader of the SNCC, helped organize sit-ins and voter registration
            drives.<br />
