            1970s. Throughout American history, most immigrants to the United States had
            come from Europe. Beginning in the 1970s, however, a majority of new immigrants
            came from the Americas and Asia. This pattern continues today. Another change
            was that the birthrate, or number of births per 1,000 people, was declining. By
            1970 Americans 65 and older became one of the fastest-growing population
            groups.<br />

        <p data-uuid="8d612db4e5894bc68fbbdfcd920f3b77">As the population grew and changed, American
            society faced challenges in trying to balance the views of all Americans. Some
            of these challenges involved women’s issues. The Equal Rights Amendment caused
            nationwide debate in the 1970s. Although the ERA was not ratified, the women’s
            movement did make important gains. A 1972 federal law known as Title IX banned
            discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs that receive federal
            funds. The number of women admitted to medical and law schools climbed quickly.
            Title IX also opened the door for many more women to participate in college
            sports and earn athletic scholarships. In 1973 the Supreme Court legalized
            abortion in the case <i>Roe </i>v. <i>Wade</i>. Opponents of abortion began to
            form groups seeking to overturn the decision. Today, the issue of abortion
            remains highly controversial.<br />

            of giving special consideration to nonwhites or women to make up for past
            discrimination. Supporters argued that minorities and women needed affirmative
            action to improve their educational and job opportunities. Opponents insisted
            that any preferences based on race or gender were unfair.</p>

            Many African Americans benefited from new opportunities in the 1970s.
            For example, the number of African Americans attending college increased. In
            1976 the number was four times higher than it had been a decade earlier. Many
            people credited affirmative action programs with this increase.<br />

        <p data-uuid="f9275eabae8d4523afe3a2a554e64f8d"><i>Silent Spring</i> was first published in 1962. It helped
            inspire a nationwide movement to improve the environment. Environmentalists in
            the United States celebrated the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. “Earth Day
            is to remind each person of his [or her] . . . equal responsibility . . . to
            preserve and improve the Earth,” explained activists.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f6c056d78151402194fa6f64950c9461">
            Environmentalists brought attention to other issues in addition to
            pollution. These issues included the risks of nuclear power, the overuse of
            natural resources, and the loss of natural habitats due to human development.
            Many environmentalists linked these problems to population growth. From 1900 to
            1975, there were major changes in population. The population of the United
            States nearly tripled. The world’s population grew from roughly 1.6 billion to
            4 billion.<br />

        </figure>
        <p data-uuid="20180ddb36514edda35a9ea7c253c385">Congress passed new laws to limit the release
            of pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in
            1970 to carry out these laws. The mission of the EPA is to protect human health
            and the environment. It conducts research and writes and enforces rules to
            provide this protection.</p>
        <p data-uuid="bd0586b5a0a24356ae200a0a0d7690ac">One of the EPA’s major efforts has been to
            reduce acid rain. It can form when air pollution mixes with water in the
            atmosphere. Acid rain can fall hundreds of miles from the source of pollution,
            harming plants and wildlife. In 1976 a scientist found that many of the lakes
            in Adirondack Park in New York State no longer had any fish because the water
            had become too acidic. In 1990 the EPA created a program to reduce pollution
            that causes acid rain.</p>
        <p data-uuid="77b5001cd3c44f2f97dda21db847a038">
            The government also took action to repair damage caused by pollution. In
            1980 Congress passed a law to promote the cleanup of heavily contaminated
            sites. The Love Canal disaster in the town of Niagara Falls, New York, inspired
            the creation of the law. Chemical companies had dumped large quantities of
            toxic waste into the canal before it was closed and covered with earth. A
            school and rows of homes were built nearby. Residents began to report high
            rates of serious health problems. Eventually, more than 900 families were moved
            from the site.<br />

            crisis, especially in the Midwest and the Northeast. As middle-class families
            moved to new suburbs following World War II, businesses followed them. Cities
            were harmed by the loss of jobs and taxpayers as well as by social problems
            such as crime and drug abuse. These conditions, known as urban decay, drove
            even more families to leave.<br />
