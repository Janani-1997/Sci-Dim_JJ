        <p data-uuid="4a268b9d963d4798b210974d7bf95ab1">In 1858 Illinois Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln for the U.S. Senate. His opponent was Democrat Stephen Douglas, who had represented Illinois in the Senate since 1847. Lincoln challenged Douglas in what became the historic <b><dfn title="Lincoln-Douglas debates">Lincoln-Douglas debates</dfn></b>. In all, Lincoln and Douglas agreed to hold seven debates in seven different Illinois cities. Each lasted three hours. In addition to their political differences, the two men presented a strong contrast in physical appearance. Lincoln stood no less than six feet four inches, more than a foot taller than Douglas.</p>

        <p data-uuid="f173b51e859b49a3b2e707ac695723cf">In each debate, Lincoln stressed that the central issue of the campaign was the spread of slavery in the West. He said that the Democrats were trying to spread slavery across the nation.</p>
        <p data-uuid="dac8be7ce3254f27a1a869a57dc44331">Lincoln talked about the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision. He said that African Americans were “entitled to all the natural rights” listed in the Declaration of Independence, specifically mentioning “the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” However, Lincoln believed that African Americans were not necessarily the social or political equals of whites. Hoping to cost Lincoln votes, Douglas charged that Lincoln “thinks that the Negro is his brother. . . .”</p>
        <p data-uuid="2c69bae4d20c49ec94786e53eecc9c93"> Douglas also criticized Lincoln for saying that the nation could not remain “half slave and half free.” Douglas said that the statement revealed a Republican desire to make every state a free state. This, he warned, would only lead to “a dissolution [destruction] of the Union” and “warfare between the North and the South.”<br />

        <p data-uuid="5ce63d054abb468da1cc622e690ca655">At the second debate, in the northern Illinois town of Freeport, Lincoln pressed Douglas on the apparent contradiction between the Democrats’ belief in popular sovereignty and the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision. Lincoln asked Douglas to explain how, if Congress could not ban slavery from a federal territory, Congress could allow the citizens of that territory to ban it.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c33e35478a544df0b1f34de0f6925c82">Douglas responded that it did not matter what the Supreme Court decided about slavery. He argued that “the people have the lawful means to introduce it or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a day or an hour anywhere, unless it is supported by local police regulations.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="8d0d19e36f7c42ef8894a454e756fdd5">This notion that the police would enforce the voters’ decision if it contradicted the Supreme Court’s decision in the <i>Dred Scott</i> case became known as the <b><dfn title="Freeport Doctrine">Freeport Doctrine</dfn></b>.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b0b3e6719bcb49aaac6653ed027787a9"> The Freeport Doctrine put the slavery question back in the hands of American citizens. It helped Douglas win the Senate seat. Lincoln, while not victorious, became a strong, important leader of the Republican Party.<br />
