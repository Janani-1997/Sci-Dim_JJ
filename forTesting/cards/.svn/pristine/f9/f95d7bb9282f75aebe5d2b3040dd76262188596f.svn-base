            arrived in North America during the last Ice Age. At the start of the Ice Age, Earth’s
            climate became intensely cold. Large amounts of water froze into huge, moving
            sheets of ice called glaciers. As a result, ocean levels dropped more than 300
            feet lower than they are today. </p>

            When
            the sea level fell, a land bridge between northeastern Asia and present-day
            Alaska was exposed. Geographers call this strip of land the <b><dfn title="Bering Land Bridge">Bering Land Bridge</dfn></b>. Although no one
            knows exactly when or how people crossed into North America, evidence suggests
            that people called <b><dfn title="Paleo-lndians">Paleo-Indians</dfn></b>
            crossed this bridge into Alaska between 38,000 and 10,000 BC.</p>

            and the Ice Age ended. Rising temperatures melted glaciers. Water levels in the
            oceans rose, and the Bering Land Bridge was covered with water.</p>

            The
            Bering Land Bridge migration is just one theory about how people might have
            arrived in the Americas. In recent years, some scientists have proposed additional
            routes for early migrations. These scientists point to sites in South America
            that were occupied by humans long before people could have arrived by foot from
            Beringia, the area surrounding the Bering Land Bridge. One theory suggests that
            people from East Asia may have traveled to the Americas by boat. They could
            have stayed in sight of land as they sailed north and then south along the
            coast.&#160;</p>

            and landscapes that surround living things. Large herds of animals such as
            buffalo and deer ate new short grasses that thrived in the warm climate. As the
            number of these animals grew, Paleo-Indians hunted them for resources such as

            Like

            seeds, and eventually learned to breed animals, farm, and grow plants. Maize,
            or corn, was one of their most important early crops, and learning to cultivate forever changed life in the Americas.</p>
