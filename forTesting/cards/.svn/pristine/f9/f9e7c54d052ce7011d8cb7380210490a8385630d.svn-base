        <p data-uuid="32a53a1874d946ad98a36404b43fb154">The success of early trailblazers convinced thousands of families and individuals to make the dangerous journey west. They came for many different reasons, yet they all shared the dream of new opportunities and a better life. They traveled along a series of routes—the Oregon, Santa Fe, and Mormon Trails—that led west. Once there, the new pioneers claimed the land and established settlements.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="eb7bc4c445dc4c65b224fadd74133501">The Oregon Trail</h3>
        <p data-uuid="6e03618fd5594dbdadc34431aa8fb845">Many settlers moving to Oregon Country and other western areas followed the 2,000-mile-long <dfn title="Oregon Trail">Oregon Trail</dfn>, which stretched from places such as Independence, Missouri, or Council Bluffs, Iowa, west into Oregon Country. The trail followed the Platte and Sweetwater Rivers over the Plains. After it crossed the Rocky Mountains, the trail forked. The northern branch led to the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The other branch went to California and became known as the California Trail.</p>

        </section>
        <p data-uuid="aeff840e550e4bb28e1fbf10e8074862">Traveling the trail challenged the strength and determination of&#160;pioneer families. The journey usually began after the rainy season ended in late spring and lasted about six months. Young families made up most groups of settlers. They gathered in wagon trains for the trip. There could be as few as 10 wagons or as many as several dozen in a wagon train. They kept up a tiring pace. Settler Jesse Applegate recalled the advice he received from one experienced Oregon pioneer: “Travel, travel, TRAVEL … Nothing is good that causes a moment's delay.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="5058e08e2727438b97cdf4ffd4d8a63c">Some pioneers brought small herds of cattle with them on the trail. They faced severe hardships, including shortages of food, supplies, and water. Rough weather and geographic barriers, such as rivers and mountains, sometimes forced large numbers of pioneers to abandon their wagons. In the early days of the Oregon Trail, many Native Americans helped the pioneers, acting as guides and messengers. The pioneers also traded with the Native Americans, exchanging goods for food. Although newspapers sometimes reported Native American “massacres” of pioneers, few settlers died from Indian attacks.<br />

        <p data-uuid="189f4f768cde4e97a8f0646c864548b3">The settlers who arrived safely in Oregon and California found generally healthy and pleasant climates. By 1845 some 5,000 settlers occupied the Willamette Valley.</p>

        <p data-uuid="370e1d37004645fa835f659e49ae6626"><dfn title="Santa Fe Trail">The Santa Fe Trail</dfn> was another important path west. It led from Independence, Missouri, to Santa Fe, New Mexico. It followed an ancient trading route first used by Native Americans. American traders loaded their wagon trains with cloth and other manufactured goods to exchange for horses, mules, and silver from Mexican traders in Santa Fe.</p>

        <p data-uuid="e8cb68d8212a4d4aa6a9861814847214">The long trip across blazing deserts and rough mountains was dangerous. But the lure of high profits encouraged traders to take to the trail. One trader reported a 2,000 percent profit on his cargo. The U.S. government helped protect traders by sending troops to ensure that Native Americans were not a threat.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="cfef3036a1f948d38dd3a599530ca718">Mormons Travel West</h3>
        <p data-uuid="d2fbef46c2c14fd1829fec76ef51d636">One large group of settlers traveled to the West in search of religious freedom. In 1830 a young man named Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in western New York. The members of Joseph Smith's church became known as <dfn title="Mormon">Mormons</dfn>. Smith told his followers that he had found and translated a set of golden tablets containing religious teachings. The writings were called the Book of Mormon.</p>

        <p data-uuid="2d9ae39db48349fe9c8d87a456b27009">Church membership grew rapidly, but certain beliefs and practices caused Mormons to be persecuted. For example, beginning in the 1850s some Mormon men practiced polygamy—a practice in which one man is married to several women at the same time. This practice was outlawed&#160;by the church in 1890.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4f45842b214147cfba63cac4b562da52">In the early 1830s Smith and his growing number of converts left New&#160;York. They formed new communities, first in Ohio, then in Missouri, and finally in Illinois. All three communities eventually failed, and an anti-Mormon mob murdered Smith in 1844. Following Smith’s murder, <b><dfn title="Young, Brigham">Brigham Young</dfn></b> became head of the Mormon Church. Young chose what is now Utah as the group’s new home, and thousands of Mormons took the Mormon Trail to the area near the Great Salt Lake, where they prospered. By 1860 there were about 40,000 Mormons in Utah.<br />
