            Education </i>had a major impact on American society. However, segregation
            continued to be enforced in many other public places and facilities in the
            South. One major area that remained segregated was public transportation.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d7fd6a189ecd4f4b8eb81af927e8550d">The NAACP decided to continue the battle
            against segregation in Montgomery, Alabama. Black passengers there were
            required to sit in the back of city buses. If the whites-only front section
            filled up, black passengers had to give up their seats.</p>
        <p data-uuid="176909913af649e8baecf4c403a09bab">
            On
            December 1, 1955, a seamstress and NAACP worker named <dfn title="Parks, Rosa">Rosa Parks</dfn> boarded a bus
            and sat in the front row of the section reserved for black passengers. When the
            bus became full, the driver told Parks and three others to give their seats to
            white passengers. Parks refused. The bus driver called the police, and Parks
            was taken to jail.<br />

                a powerful and moving speaker, King became one of the leading voices of the
                civil rights movement. He was committed to achieving equality through
                nonviolent protest. He led a series of successful marches and protests,

                to the boycotts, sit-ins, and marches that helped African Americans gain equal
                treatment. King’s work helped bring an end to legal segregation and led to new

            empty buses down the city streets. Leaders planned a carpool system that helped
            people find rides at more than 40 locations throughout Montgomery. For 381
            days, boycotters carpooled, took taxis, rode bicycles, and walked. Still,
            Montgomery’s leaders refused to integrate the bus system.<br />

            segregation fight, many white residents were angry about the attempt to end
            segregation. Some people resorted to violence. King’s home was bombed, and he
            received hate mail and phone calls threatening him and his family. The police
            also harassed and arrested carpool drivers. In spite of this intimidation, the
            boycott gained national attention, sparking similar protests in other cities.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f26aec16c1b349b5af832fed15c29944">Finally, in November 1956 the Supreme Court
            ruled that segregation on public transportation was illegal. The next month,
            King joined other black and white ministers to ride the first integrated bus in
            Montgomery. “It . . . makes you feel that America is a great country and we’re
            going to do more to make it greater,” remembered Jo Ann Robinson.</p>

            The
            Montgomery bus boycott helped make Martin Luther King Jr. a nationally known
            civil rights leader. He formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
            (SCLC), which led campaigns for civil rights throughout the South.<br />
