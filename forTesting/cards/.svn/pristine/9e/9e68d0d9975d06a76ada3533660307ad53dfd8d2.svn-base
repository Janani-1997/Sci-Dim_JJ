        <p data-uuid="d5ba6813713f47bdba10d66e442ed836">The
            North, first of all, had an economy based on trade and on manufacturing.
            Northerners supported tariffs because tariffs helped them compete with British
            factories. Northerners also opposed the federal government’s sale of public
            land at cheap prices. Cheap land encouraged potential laborers to move from
            northern factory towns to the West.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5dac80f44c0f4aa793f33adc63304cb2">The
            second region was the South. Its economy was based on farming. Southern farmers
            raised all types of crops, but the most popular were the cash crops of cotton
            and tobacco. Southerners sold a large portion of their crops to foreign
            nations.</p>
        <p data-uuid="0d077b543f05493ba6f084367c66b191">Southerners
            imported their manufactured goods. Tariffs made imported goods more expensive
            for southern farmers. In addition, high tariffs angered some of the South’s
            European trading partners. These trading partners would likely raise their own
            tariffs in retaliation. To avoid this situation, southerners called for low
            tariffs.</p>
        <p data-uuid="377d1c4f8ddc453c80d937b20211919f">Southerners
            also relied on enslaved African Americans to work the plantations. The issue of
            slavery would become increasingly controversial between the North and South.</p>
        <p data-uuid="2eabefdc7ddb47e4b2feb9871c5a8035">Political parties also developed
            along these regional lines. They were influenced by the tariff policy. Tariffs,
            sometimes called protective tariffs, were favored by Republicans, mostly
            northerners, because they protected northern manufacturing. Democrats, mostly
            southerners, were against tariffs because they made goods they needed to import
            much more expensive. </p>
        <p data-uuid="a7d3b1c90611408cbd2d27908529bd00">In the third region, the West, the frontier economy
            was just emerging. Settlers favored policies that boosted their farming economy
            and encouraged further settlement. Western farmers grew a wide variety of
            crops. Their biggest priority was cheap land and internal improvements such as
            better roads and water transportation.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="faf86e71089446f0b1b74aa2779f1560">Tariff of Abominations </h3>
        <p data-uuid="bf191caa5f464b6785ce9d7959a4a140">Tariffs became one of the first issues of debate that President Jackson
            faced. In 1827, the year before Jackson’s election, northern manufacturers
            began to demand a tariff on imported woolen goods. Northerners wanted the
            tariff to protect their industries from &#173;foreign competition, especially from
            Great Britain. For them the tariff helped meet economic challenges. </p>
        <p data-uuid="78aaafab063e44aea5116adad1df5628">British
            companies were driving American ones out of business with their inexpensive
            manufactured goods. The tariff northerners supported, however, was so high that
            importing wool would be impossible. Southerners opposed the tariff, saying it
            would hurt their economy.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7c5f19b9e79b48c59b7760047c559aa5">Before
            Andrew Jackson took office, Congress placed a high tariff on&#160;imports.
            Angry southerners called it the <b><dfn title="Tariff of Abominations">Tariff
            of Abominations</dfn></b>. (An&#160;abomination is a
            hateful thing.) Southern voters were outraged.</p>
        <p data-uuid="7bb23f8b70194ef3869a76d9971acfcf">President
            John Quincy Adams signed the tariff legislation, though he did not fully
            support it. In early U.S. history, presidents tended to reserve veto power for
            legislation that they believed violated the Constitution. Signing the tariff
            bill meant Adams would surely be defeated in his re-election bid. The new
            tariff added fuel to the growing sectional differences plaguing the young
            nation. Citing states’ rights, some southerners said that the states could
            nullify laws they felt were not authorized by the Constitution. Most
            northerners opposed nullification.</p>
