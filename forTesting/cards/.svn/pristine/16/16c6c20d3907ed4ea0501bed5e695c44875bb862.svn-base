        <p data-uuid="819c1e33529e400b98542d0ecd24684e">Immediately after taking the oath of office in March 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the nation. In his first inaugural address, Roosevelt told nervous Americans that economic recovery was possible. “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” he said, “nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror.” It was only fear of the future, he argued, that could keep America from moving forward. Roosevelt spoke openly of the severe problems facing the American people—unemployment, failing banks, and products with no markets. He promised that the government would help. “This nation asks for action,” he said, “and action now.” </p>
        <p data-uuid="c875dcee9f5d41488b2cafc4698c2457">The action began when Roosevelt called Congress into a special session. Known as the Hundred Days, the session started just after the inauguration and lasted until the middle of June. During the Hundred Days, Roosevelt and Congress worked together to create new programs to battle the Depression and aid economic recovery. These programs became known as the <b><dfn title="New Deal">New Deal</dfn></b>.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="5a49f7cd95d44be6900bdf1cace7cf05">Restoring Confidence</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9bed790fa3454c3e9ba6618c4d60ea0c">One of Roosevelt’s first goals was to restore confidence in American banks. The day after his inauguration, Roosevelt announced a “bank holiday.” He ordered all banks to close temporarily. Three days later, Congress’s special session began. Congress quickly passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act. President Roosevelt signed it into law.<br />

        <p data-uuid="b1224ee017b64da8b4af39699ca52091">That Sunday, President Roosevelt gave the first of his fireside chats—radio addresses in which he spoke directly to the American people. In this first fireside chat, he explained the new bank relief law. The government would inspect the finances of every bank and allow only healthy banks to reopen. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was established to help maintain stability in the United States financial system. It provided government insurance for deposits made into eligible banks. People no longer needed to fear losing their savings in the event of another bank failure. The new bank law and Roosevelt’s fireside chat helped Americans trust banks with their money again. As banks reopened, there were no rushes to withdraw money. Over the next month Americans deposited almost $1 billion in banks. </p>

        <p data-uuid="fe2cb263db164c26a257bdcc025ce6f0">Roosevelt next turned his attention to other serious problems. In 1933 some 13 million Americans were unemployed. This represented about 25 percent of the nation’s workforce. New Deal programs helped to get Americans back to work. The Civil Works Administration (CWA) employed more than 4 million Americans, building roads and airports. One grateful CWA worker expressed the feelings of many when he said, “I was working, and I could again hold my head up when I met people.” The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) provided jobs for hundreds of thousands of people. They worked on projects such as planting trees and improving national parks.</p>

This brought electricity and jobs to communities in the Tennessee River valley. The New Deal also included programs to help farmers.
