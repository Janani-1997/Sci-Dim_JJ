As World War II ended, President Truman was worried about a similar downturn. More than 16 million Americans had served in the armed forces during the war. Now they were coming home, and most would be looking for work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="31962102774d48809bd498251f9c9884">President Truman, who was sworn in as president when Roosevelt died in 1945, led the country through the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War. He had been an artillery officer in France during World War I, and he was familiar with the issues veterans faced returning from war.<br />

Then he returned to Missouri and later became active in politics. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1934, where he served until becoming vice-president in 1945. When President Roosevelt died, Truman was sworn in as president of the United States. “I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me,” he said. Truman later called his first year in office a “year of decisions,” as he led the country through the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War.</p>

        <p data-uuid="03099a50eb2a41e18e1d1443677eda6c">To provide jobs for returning veterans, the government urged the millions of women who had gone to work during the war to give up their jobs. New laws also eased the transition for returning soldiers. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, or <dfn title="6b79440be8df4fffaf7d45c83f401fb1">GI Bill of Rights</dfn>, offered veterans money for school as well as loans for houses, farms, and businesses. The GI Bill’s home loans enabled veterans to buy about 20 percent of the new houses built right after the war. Some 8 million veterans used the GI Bill’s educational benefits to attend colleges and technical schools to receive training for jobs. Thousands more took out loans to open their own businesses. Bob Dole, former U.S. senator from Kansas, described how the GI Bill changed his life.</p>

        <p data-uuid="24f37282aa064a28980bcfdfa0db0aa4">Another major postwar change was Truman’s decision to end the rationing of scarce products. Prices skyrocketed as people rushed to buy gasoline and other products that had been limited during the war. The inflation rate in 1946 rose above 18 percent. The U.S. economy remained strong, however.<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="691c3f36d466462ebca7ff4cd78d2b18">Labor Unrest</h3>
        <p data-uuid="bfa356a2267249c28f9735d2c3dff13c">More than 35 percent of all nonfarm workers were members of unions in 1946, more than ever before. With prices rising quickly, workers went on strike to demand higher wages. In 1946 alone, 4.5 million workers participated in nearly 5,000 strikes.</p>
        <p data-uuid="33f19310532743c4ab03b9f22fd43325">The strikes became a major political problem for President Truman. Many people began to wonder if he could handle the presidency. In April 1946 the 400,000-member United Mine Workers of America union went on strike. When Truman was unable to negotiate a settlement, he placed the mines under government control. In May Truman ended a railroad strike by threatening to draft all the striking workers into the army.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4f9e251c637c43d9bc0898727005cadc"> To reduce the power of labor unions, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. This act outlawed closed shops—businesses that could hire only union members. It also allowed the president to order an 80-day “cooling-off” period before a strike began. In addition, union leaders had to swear they were not Communists. In spite of his clashes with unions, Truman thought this bill went too far to weaken unions. He vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode his veto.<br />

        <p data-uuid="81d6c99f55d34e7f8bca2c485a4ed756">After serving their country in World War II, many African Americans faced prejudice and segregation at home. “Black servicemen were overseas dying for this country,” said civil rights lawyer Constance Baker Motley. “And . . . they would be coming home to a situation that said, in effect, you’re a second-class citizen.” African American veterans helped lead a major effort to gain equal rights.</p>

Robinson became a hero to millions by ending segregation in major league baseball. He went on to be a Hall of Fame player—and an outspoken supporter of equal rights. “The right of every American to first-class citizenship is the most important issue of our time,” Robinson said.</p>

        <p data-uuid="ea8f230777ca4ebb87e95352bae1c254"> Truman responded in 1946 by appointing the Committee on Civil Rights to investigate discrimination and suggest solutions. As a result of the committee’s report, Truman recommended that Congress pass anti-lynching laws, outlaw segregation, and protect civil rights. Congress failed to act on Truman’s ideas. But in 1948, under pressure from African American groups, Truman issued an executive order ending segregation in the armed forces. He also banned discrimination in the hiring of federal employees.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="de8e64d0590f45e4a614a0a5b1328cb4">The Election of 1948</h3>
        <p data-uuid="cdd378e803884e9ba24803826f584bd8">As the election of 1948 drew near, President Truman’s chances of re-election looked bleak. The Republicans had gained control of Congress in 1946. They felt confident that their presidential candidate, New York governor Thomas Dewey, could beat Truman.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ed341e789d7a4387ae6be8576f45197f">Truman faced challenges from within the Democratic Party as well. Some southern Democrats protested Truman’s support for civil rights laws by walking out of the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Many joined the States’ Rights Party, or Dixiecrats, which favored racial segregation. The Dixiecrats nominated their own presidential candidate—South Carolina governor Strom Thurmond.</p>

        <p data-uuid="64d10c8685e04000a942546bc60a2aad">Truman took his case for re-election directly to the American people. He traveled more than 30,000 miles by train and delivered hundreds of speeches. He attacked what he called the “do-nothing, good-for-nothing” Congress for refusing to pass his legislation.</p>
        <p data-uuid="9e6b8795886444f98d284a062393aab6">“I spoke I believe altogether to between fifteen and twenty million people,” he later said. “I met them face to face, and I convinced them, and they voted for me.” Truman won a surprise victory. The Democratic Party also regained control of both houses of Congress.</p>
        <p data-uuid="22209eef8c904fa1888f750eea132135"> In his 1949 State of the Union Address, Truman urged Congress to support his plans for the nation. Truman’s domestic program, called the <b><dfn title="Fair Deal">Fair Deal</dfn></b>, included a higher minimum wage, the creation of a national health insurance plan for all Americans, and expanded Social Security benefits for the elderly. It also asked for federal protection of civil rights and an end to racial discrimination in hiring.<br />
