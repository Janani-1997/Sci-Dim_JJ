            enslaved African Americans lived in rural areas where they worked on farms and
            plantations. Enslaved people on small farms usually did a variety of jobs. On
            large plantations, most slaves were assigned to specific jobs, and most worked
            in the fields. Most slaveholders demanded that slaves work as much as possible.
            Supervisors known as drivers, who were sometimes slaves themselves, made sure
            that slaves followed orders. Drivers also carried out punishments.<br />

                        labor to operate. Many people were needed to work in the fields, but slaves
                        also worked in planters’ homes or in other buildings on the property, such as
                        the blacksmith’s forge, or workshop.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="4909d91d37ef4f26a57d0bb43e1174d3">Working in the
            Field</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9c58cce19cd14e979af7e2a67a62ff45">Most
            plantation owners used the gang-labor system. In this system, all field hands
            worked on the same task at the same time. They usually worked from sunup to
            sundown. Former slave Harry McMillan had worked on a plantation in South
            Carolina. He recalled that the field hands usually did not even get a break to
            eat lunch. “You had to get your victuals [food] standing at your hoe,” he
            remembered.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5f6190aa38ea4efbaa2458daad3c7b6c">Men, women, and even
            children older than about ten usually did the same tasks. Sickness and poor
            weather rarely stopped the work. “The times I hated most was picking cotton
            when the frost was on the bolls [seed pods],” recalled former Louisiana slave
            Mary Reynolds. “My hands git sore and crack open and bleed.”</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="6089afe81b864f90bdbf14789bff5b53">Working in the
            Planter’s Home</h3>
        <p data-uuid="7998a01201fb46e68f3bd3251a3e24b3">Some slaves worked as
            butlers, cooks, or nurses in the planter’s home. These slaves often had better
            food, clothing, and shelter than field hands did, but they often worked longer
            hours. They had to serve the planter’s family 24 hours a day.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="c57224c417a54a3783acc22009d321b0">Working at
            Skilled Jobs</h3>
        <p data-uuid="c1dbe7ebae244c758eab9a326e15f44b">
            On
            larger plantations, some enslaved African Americans worked at skilled jobs,
            such as blacksmithing or carpentry. Sometimes planters let these slaves sell their
            services to other people. Often planters collected a portion of what was earned
            but allowed slaves to keep the rest. In this way, some skilled slaves earned
            enough money to buy their freedom from their slaveholders. For example, William
            Ellison earned his freedom in South Carolina by working for wages as a cotton
            gin maker. For years he worked late at night and on Sundays. He bought his
            freedom with the money he earned. Eventually he was also able to buy the
            freedom of his wife and daughter.<br />
