        <p data-uuid="2e1dc2e492e74eef989dd240f350305c">Although violent slave revolts were relatively rare, white southerners lived in fear of them. Two planned rebellions were stopped before they began. Gabriel Prosser planned a rebellion near Richmond, Virginia, in 1800. Denmark Vesey planned one in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1822. Local authorities executed most of those involved in planning these rebellions. Though Vesey was executed as the leader of the Charleston conspiracy, several accounts written after his death by antislavery writers claimed he was a hero.</p>
        <p data-uuid="d25c29b641074cf199904428a7434c48"> The most violent slave revolt in the country occurred in 1831 and is known as <dfn title="Nat Turner’s Rebellion">Nat Turner’s Rebellion</dfn>.<b> </b><dfn title="Turner, Nat">Nat Turner</dfn>, a slave from Southampton County, Virginia, believed that God had told him to end slavery. On an August night in 1831, Turner led a group of slaves in a plan to kill all of the slaveholders and their families in the county. First they attacked the family who held Turner as a slave. Soon they had killed about 60 white people in the community.<br />

        <p data-uuid="517de76e9eef475ebca50b66d8acc69f">Before his trial, Turner made a confession. He expressed his belief that the revolt was justified and worth his death: “I am willing to suffer the fate that awaits me.” Turner was executed on November 11, 1831. After the rebellion, many states strengthened their slave codes. The new codes placed stricter control on enslaved people. Despite resistance, slavery continued to spread.</p>
