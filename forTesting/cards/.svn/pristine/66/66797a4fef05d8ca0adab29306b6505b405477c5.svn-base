        <p data-uuid="3837ce2dcdf04842be3768b5c05ced28">Workers no longer needed the specific skills of
            craftspeople to run the machines of the new mills. The lives of workers changed
            along with their jobs. Resistance to these changes sometimes sparked protests.</p>
        <p data-uuid="e5d297e6386b4c65b212a03342065f2f">Many mill owners in the United States could not find enough
            people to work in factories because other jobs were available. At first, Samuel
            Slater and his two partners used apprentices—young men who worked for several
            years to learn the trade. However, they often were given only simple work. For
            example, their jobs might include feeding cotton into the machines and cleaning
            the mill equipment. They grew tired of this work and frequently left.
            Apprentice James Horton, for example, ran away from Slater’s mill. “Mr. Slater
            . . . keep me always at one thing . . . ,” Horton complained. “I might have
            stayed there until this time and never knew nothing.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="853e2602183a4781922b5484ac1780c5">Eventually, Slater began to hire entire families who
            moved to Pawtucket to work in the mills. This practice allowed Slater to fill
            his labor needs at a low cost. Children as well as adults worked in the mills.</p>
        <p data-uuid="b84804bdc26a42c98380f27205bbb2bf">On most farms children worked to help their
            families. Therefore, few people complained about the hiring of children to work
            in factories. H. Humphrey, an author of books on raising children, told parents
            that children needed to be useful. Humphrey wrote, “If he [a child] will not
            study, put him on to a farm, or send him into the shop, or in some other way
            provide regular employment for him.” The machines made many tasks in the mill
            simple enough for children to do. Mill owners profited because they paid
            children low wages. Adults usually earned as much in a day as most children did
            in a week.</p>

                        families was common at the time, especially in Britain. In America, it became known
                        as the Rhode Island system.</p>

        <p data-uuid="531ba898079e41bf8c34d2b04976b050">To attract families to his mill, Slater built housing
            for the workers. He also provided them with a company store where they could
            buy necessities. In addition, he started the practice of paying workers with
            credit at the company store. Instead of paying the full price for an item all
            at once, small payments could be made over a period of time. This practice
            allowed Slater to reinvest his money in his business.</p>
        <p data-uuid="6977f92e9b214e0f82406e68f1811dda">Slater’s strategy of hiring families and dividing
            factory work into simple tasks became known as the <b><dfn title="Rhode Island system">Rhode Island system</dfn></b>. Mill owners throughout the Northeast
            copied Slater’s methods. Owners advertised with “Men with growing families
            wanted.” They also sent recruiters to poor communities to find new workers. For
            many people, the chance to work in a factory was a welcome opportunity to earn
            money and to learn a new skill.</p>

        <p data-uuid="737dfe4194844dbcb06939796000b886">One of the earliest of the mill towns, Slatersville,
            was named after&#160;Samuel
            Slater. The town was built by Slater and his brother John. It included two
            houses for workers and their families, the owner’s house, the company store,
            and the Slatersville Mill. The mill was the largest and most modern industrial
            building of its time.</p>
        <p data-uuid="da12857f339b4ac7bd9fa318f9cad8cc">The mills employed not only the textile workers who
            operated the machinery but also machine part makers and dam builders. Although the
            company store sold food and necessary items to workers, mill towns supported
            the same variety of businesses any other town needed to thrive. These included
            tailors and dressmakers, butchers, and other small workshops.</p>
