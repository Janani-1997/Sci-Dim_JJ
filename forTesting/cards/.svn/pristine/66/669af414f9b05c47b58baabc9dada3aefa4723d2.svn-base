        <p data-uuid="ecd92427c3f84df0a3b2e77e4f19a90e">Other conflicts were happening on the frontier. Congress passed a tax on American-made whiskey in March 1791. The tax was part of Hamilton’s plan to raise money to help pay the federal debt. He was also testing the power of the federal government to control the states’ actions.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="263cfd16d8c94add9aa81c7203a37153">Reaction in the West</h3>
        <p data-uuid="437868191a7642cb9ead667247316982">People in the western parts of states such as Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina were bitter about the tax. They were already angry with the federal government, which they believed did not protect settlers from Native American attacks and did not allow settlers enough opportunities for trade. The farmers’ corn crops were often made into whiskey, which was easier to transport than the corn. Because cash was rare, whiskey became like money in their region. The farmers believed that the tax was aimed specifically at them.</p>
        <p data-uuid="41ee7d993ad04a8393c15bf73928dbac">Farmers who produced small amounts of whiskey for trade argued that they could not afford the tax. They believed they should be able to keep the money they had made from a product they created themselves. Protests in 1792 led President Washington to issue a proclamation saying that people had to obey the law.</p>
        <p data-uuid="96adfb046d174ea0b4428abaed64233f">Westerners also disliked the fact that cases about the law were to be tried in a district court. These courts were usually far away from the people they affected and were a great inconvenience to them.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="b445124345034ab6b45519c24b3df836">Whiskey Rebellion Is Crushed</h3>
        <p data-uuid="3c8507cd1be04b5c9cfbc2e17ce1ed66"> The complaints of western Pennsylvanians were at first expressed peacefully. But by 1794, fighting had broken out. In what became known as the <dfn title="Whiskey Rebellion">Whiskey Rebellion</dfn>, farmers lashed out against the tax on whiskey. In this letter to the governor of Pennsylvania, Alexander Hamilton threatens to send militia to Pennsylvania to stop the rebellion.</p>

        <p data-uuid="eb9652532dca469d825000d61d359f80">Incidents of violence spread to other states. President Washington feared that the rebels threatened the federal government’s authority. He believed he needed to make people understand that the Constitution gave Congress the right to pass and enforce the tax.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8f5faa2974cd436a9119475811f2cc34"> Washington declared that he could “no longer remain a passive [inactive] spectator” in the event. He personally led the army in military action against the rebellion—the first and only time an American president has done so. The army of about 13,000 men approached western Pennsylvania in November 1794. By this time, most of the rebels had fled. The Whiskey Rebellion ended without a battle.<br />
