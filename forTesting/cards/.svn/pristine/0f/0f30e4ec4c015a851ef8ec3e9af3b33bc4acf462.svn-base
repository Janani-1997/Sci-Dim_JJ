        <p data-uuid="8f098d4889364adb9a7354be9134fe7c">The new textile machines allowed Great Britain to produce cloth more quickly and inexpensively than other countries could. To protect British industry, the British Parliament had made it illegal for skilled mechanics or machine plans to leave the country. Disguised as a farmer, <b><dfn title="Slater, Samuel">Samuel Slater</dfn></b>, a skilled British mechanic, immigrated to the United States after carefully memorizing the designs of textile mill machines. Soon after arriving, he sent a letter to Moses Brown, who owned a textile business in New England. Slater claimed he could improve the way textiles were manufactured in the United States.</p>
        <p data-uuid="10353981e72342cda88feadf946d60cb">Brown had one of his workers test Slater’s knowledge of machinery. Slater passed. Brown’s son, Smith Brown, and son-in-law, William Almy, formed a partnership with Slater. Economic freedom in the United States allowed entrepreneurs such as Slater, Brown, and Almy to take risks by using their money and talents to launch new ventures. In 1793 they opened their first mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The production of cotton thread by American machines had begun. Slater ran the mill and the machinery. He was confident that his new machines would work well.</p>

        <p data-uuid="74ade656cdea4571b5ea972387924444">Slater could have lost all of his investment, but his machines worked and the Pawtucket mill became a success. Slater’s wife also invented a new cotton thread for sewing. In 1798 Slater formed his own company to build a mill. By the time he died in 1835, he owned all or part of 13 textile mills.</p>
        <p data-uuid="36bb5d6c425d4b89b2d1d0b1257ba2bc">Other Americans began building textile mills. Most were located in the Northeast. In New England, in particular, merchants had the money to invest in new mills. More importantly, the physical environment in this region was made up of many rivers and streams that provided a reliable supply of power. Fewer mills were built in the South, partly because investors in the South concentrated on expanding agriculture. There, agriculture was seen as an easier way to make money. The expansion of industrialization in the North and the South’s concentration on agriculture caused the two regions to develop significant economic and cultural differences.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="5d7c300070034a0db11b5a6bacb782ae">A Manufacturing Breakthrough</h3>
        <p data-uuid="fc7d2e5be6be4468b7224815d81fa9ff">Despite these great changes in machines and processes, most manufacturing was still done by hand. In the late 1790s the U.S. government worried about a possible war with France, so it wanted more muskets for the army. Skilled workers made the parts for each weapon by hand. No two parts were exactly alike, and carefully fitting all the pieces together took much time and skill.</p>
        <p data-uuid="233e386e3f344f8eb230eab865fa6f5f">As a result, American gun makers could not produce the muskets quickly enough to satisfy the government’s demand. Factories needed better <b><dfn title="technology">technology</dfn></b>, the tools used to produce items or to do work.</p>
        <p data-uuid="5575959fc8484339b22bace43bbe63ed">In 1798 inventor <b><dfn title="Whitney, Eli">Eli Whitney</dfn></b> tried to address some of these problems. Whitney gave officials a proposal for mass-producing guns for the U.S. government using water-powered machinery.</p>

        <p data-uuid="86a9258aed734ebd8247c268f7262822">Whitney also came up with the idea of using <b><dfn title="interchangeable parts">interchangeable parts</dfn></b>—parts of a machine that are identical. Interchangeable parts became important because each part does not have to be custom-made by hand, so it saves production time. Using interchangeable parts made machines easier to assemble and broken parts easier to replace. Whitney promised to build 10,000 muskets in two years. The federal government gave him money to build his factory, and in 1801 he was called to Washington, DC, to give a demonstration.</p>
        <p data-uuid="f9714253de834e27be7dfdce2a2d0db4">Whitney stood before President John Adams and his secretary of war. He had an assortment of parts for ten guns. He then randomly chose parts and quickly assembled them into muskets. To the audience’s amazement, he repeated the process several times.</p>

Interchangeable parts sped up <dfn title="mass production">mass production</dfn>, the efficient production of large numbers of identical goods.
