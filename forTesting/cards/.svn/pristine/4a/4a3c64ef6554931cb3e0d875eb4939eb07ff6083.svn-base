        <h3 data-uuid="cca83567cc7d493a865ab93641c029a8">A New President</h3>
        <p data-uuid="9ed771e2ab3c46a6aa3822ebf74fc805"> On the evening of April 14, 1865, President Lincoln and his wife attended a play at Ford’s Theater in Washington, DC. During the play, John Wilkes Booth, a southerner who opposed Lincoln’s policies, sneaked into the president’s theater box and shot him. Lincoln was rushed to a boardinghouse across the street, where he died early the next morning. Lincoln, his leadership remembered for its honesty, deep intelligence, and high morals, became a symbol for the nation of the struggle of the Civil War.<br />

Reconstruction had now become his responsibility. He would have to win the trust of a nation shocked at its leader’s death. Johnson’s plan for bringing southern states back into the Union was similar to Lincoln’s plan. However, he decided that wealthy southerners and former Confederate officials would need a presidential pardon to receive amnesty. Johnson shocked Radical Republicans by eventually pardoning more than 7,000 people by 1866.</p>

            <p data-uuid="ad4ff92d4f354dd2b4c069c55a337971">Andrew Johnson came from humble beginnings. His first career was as a tailor; his wife taught him to write and do arithmetic. In 1857 he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Tennessee. Although he was a Democrat and a former slaveholder, Johnson remained loyal to the Union. As president, he called for a mild program for bringing the South back into the Union. In particular, he let states decide whether to give voting rights to freed African Americans. Johnson’s policies led to a break with the Radical Republicans in Congress and, finally, to his impeachment trial.</p>

        <p data-uuid="75ec42ee14ea494fb5d548ebe3eee251">Johnson was a Democrat whom Republicans had put on the ticket in 1864 to appeal to the border states. A former slaveholder, he was a stubborn man who would soon face a hostile Congress. </p>
        <p data-uuid="cd17817555e64348a921b13b110acf2d">Johnson offered a mild program for setting up new southern state governments. First, he appointed a temporary governor for each state. Then, he required that the states revise their constitutions. Next, voters elected state and federal representatives. The new state government had to declare that secession was illegal. It also had to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment and refuse to pay Confederate debts.</p>
        <p data-uuid="1b5a9af917364883b8249c0e36a90bde">By the end of 1865, all the southern states except Texas had created new governments. Johnson approved them all and declared that the United States was restored. Newly elected representatives came to Washington from each reconstructed southern state. However,   Republicans complained that many new representatives had been leaders of the Confederacy. Congress therefore refused to readmit the southern states into the Union. Clearly, the nation was still divided.</p>
