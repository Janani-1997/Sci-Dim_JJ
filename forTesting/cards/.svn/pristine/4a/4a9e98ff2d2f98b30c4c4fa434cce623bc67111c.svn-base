        <p data-uuid="1426e2c7ff0c49948ec4d354a793bc4b">Federalist James Madison promised that a bill of rights would be added to the Constitution. This promise allowed the Constitution to pass. In 1789 Madison began writing down a huge list of proposed amendments. He then presented a shorter list to the House of Representatives. Of those, the House approved 12. The states ratified ten, which took effect December 15, 1791. Those ten amendments, called the Bill of Rights, protect U.S. citizens' individual liberties.</p>
        <p data-uuid="de5366f49c5a4c199d9eabd07247c7b8">The protection of individual liberties is important in a representative democracy. Without safeguards, people’s rights would not always be protected because of <b><dfn title="majority rule">majority rule</dfn></b>. This is the idea that the greatest number of people in society can make policies for everyone. While this means that most people agree on what the law should be, it also means that smaller groups, or minorities, might lose their rights. The Bill of Rights ensures that the rights of all citizens are protected.</p>
        <p data-uuid="fdf88593539a4c329d14f6126342d28c">The ideas spelled out in the First Amendment form the most basic rights of all U.S. citizens. These fundamental rights include freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to petition.</p>

        <h3 data-uuid="a83bcb57b25d454e973b86fc21262e3e">Freedom of Religion</h3>
        <p data-uuid="5e31db201ec3496c9dcc40e306f78865">In the spirit of Thomas Jefferson’s Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the First Amendment begins, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” In other words, the government cannot support or interfere with the practice of a religion. This amendment keeps the government from favoring one religion over any other or establishing an official religion.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="a5f0bfd81940400d9d1e20f5280272c6">Freedom of Speech and of the Press</h3>
        <p data-uuid="b38810fa89b7407dbd43a4f79cf69cf8">The First Amendment also guarantees freedom of speech and of the press. This means that Americans have the right to express their own ideas and views. They also have the right to hear the ideas and views of others. Former senator Margaret Chase Smith discussed why these freedoms are important. “The key to security,” she once said, “is public information.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="2fc9cdb011cc468095b9818dea176046">The right to free speech and a free press does not mean that people can say or print anything they want to, however. The Constitution does not protect slander—false statements meant to damage someone’s reputation. Libel, or intentionally writing a lie that harms another person, is not protected, either. The Supreme Court has also ruled that speech that endangers public safety is not protected. For example, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes declared in 1919 that falsely shouting “fire” in a crowded theater is not protected as free speech. The government can also restrict speech or printed material that is considered obscene or poses a danger to national security.</p>

                    <p class="source" data-uuid="21db7d356a6749e585f9dac0b5703dc4">In June 1971 the <i>New York Times</i> began to publish articles based on secret government documents known as the Pentagon Papers. These articles revealed that U.S. officials had been lying to the American public for years about the progress of the Vietnam War. The Nixon administration obtained a court order forcing the Times and other newspapers to stop publishing articles based on the documents. In the case <i>New York Times Co.</i> v.&#160;<i>United States,</i> the Court ruled that the right to publish the articles was protected by the First Amendment. Justice Hugo Black wrote the following in his opinion.</p>

The Government's power to <b><a href="[remark:64c5f1ea66a047bdbb98cc3d9835f73f]"> censor</a></b> the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to <b><a href="[remark:3af66651f34b4cf7851439231ea9c60c]"> censure</a></b> the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And <b><a href="[remark:5af1cba7a809481e9ee6d0d086497082]"> paramount</a></b> among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell. In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their courageous reporting, the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly. In revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam war, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the Founders hoped and trusted they would do. . . .”</p>
