        <p data-uuid="55d18e0d419b49bdac9e19e80c311dc2">While soldiers and civilians around the world celebrated the end of World War I in November 1918, the tragedy of war was never far from people’s minds. When asked what the armistice meant, one British soldier simply said, “Time to bury the dead.”<br />
        </p>
        <h3 data-uuid="87aeab4766bd4bc49d544d8981924b59">War Dead</h3>
        <p data-uuid="04f98ef2649843d2a51acf62ee159da1">The number of soldiers killed in World War I was beyond anything the world had ever experienced. About 5 million Allied soldiers and 3.5 million soldiers from the Central powers died in combat. More than 20 million soldiers on both sides were wounded.<br />

        <p data-uuid="162ffc0ed8b840fa99eaad87acd3cf90">The war devastated an entire generation of young men in many European nations. In France, for example, 90 percent of the healthy young men had served in World War I. More than seven out of ten of these men were killed or wounded. While the United States escaped this extreme level of devastation, American forces did suffer heavy losses. Some 116,000 U.S. troops died and about 200,000 were wounded.<br />

        <p data-uuid="69e4f0a2191f4cd589a52e3f1b601aee">Along with the shocking human losses, the war brought financial disaster to many parts of Europe. Factories and farms were left in ruins. “For mile after mile nothing was left,” said one British visitor about the French countryside. “No building was habitable [livable] and no field fit for the plow.” With farmers unable to raise crops, severe food shortages occurred.</p>
        <p data-uuid="c78f0f6a1f494b67a7500bf635c5b819"> The overall economic cost of the war was huge. Property worth $30 billion had been destroyed. The Allies had spent $145 billion on the war effort, and the Central powers had spent $63 billion. France and Britain had borrowed large amounts of money to fight the war, and now they were deeply in debt to American banks. Germany was also in debt, and its people faced starvation.<br />

        <h3 data-uuid="f1cdd0b22db7400db400fdf457ddb693">The Influenza Epidemic</h3>
        <p data-uuid="413a0e6ccb694fdf9f0b9bbe601be0ef">The world was in for another shock in 1918 when a worldwide epidemic of influenza, or flu, broke out. The virus was extremely contagious and deadly. Over the next two years, it spread around the world, killing approximately 30 million people—even more than the war itself.<br />

        <p data-uuid="b09fd2e767aa475c98190aa2e1545287">The epidemic started in an army training camp in Kansas. Because the flu is transmitted through the air, it spread rapidly. American soldiers unknowingly spread the disease to other army camps, to American civilians, and eventually to soldiers and civilians in Europe. One American doctor said that seeing stacks of bodies at an army camp in Massachusetts “beats any sight they ever had in France after a battle.” Half of the Americans who died during this period died from influenza.</p>
        <p data-uuid="a133ee9a1daf4281961a2b8e840fcfe3"> The epidemic changed life everywhere in the United States. In Chicago, for example, the flu more than doubled the normal death rate in the fall of 1918. Many of those killed were young and strong. State and local governments took measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Kearney, Nebraska, imposed a quarantine, forbidding people who were ill from leaving their homes. Many cities banned public gatherings, including school classes. A man named Dan Tonkel remembered what life was like for children in his hometown of Goldsboro, North Carolina.<br />

        <p data-uuid="5738e4ac1d0c474cac9347d23555a3b2">Although there was no cure for the flu, people would try anything. One woman surrounded her daughter with raw onions. Another remembered, “We hung bags of . . . garlic about our necks. We smelled awful, but it was okay, because everyone smelled bad.” By the time the influenza epidemic ended in 1919, it had killed 800,000 Americans at home and abroad. Today, vaccinations help prevent major outbreaks of the flu and other contagious diseases.<br />
