        <p data-uuid="e2b57b3a9df74db99477f67adf77cbe5">Free African Americans usually lived in segregated, or separate, communities in the North. Most of them lived in cities such as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Community leaders were often influenced by the Second Great Awakening and its spirit of reform.</p>
        <p data-uuid="36ed596a86a042f4b0b3cd86586c9b6b"> Founded by former slave Richard Allen, the Free African Religious Society became a model for other groups that pressed for racial equality and the education of blacks. In 1816 Allen became the first bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, or AME Church. This church broke away from white Methodist churches after African Americans were treated poorly in some white congregations.<br />

                <p class="caption" data-uuid="33a56f1ec5784efe937220e8710b40b8"> Some churches became more integrated, and preachers like the one pictured began calling for equality between races.</p>

        <p data-uuid="3311d6b8ea5b40cb9082c9208dff0f4a">Other influential African Americans of the time, such as Alexander Crummel, pushed for the creation of schools for black Americans. The New York African Free School in New York City educated hundreds of children, many of whom became brilliant scholars and important African American leaders. Philadelphia also had a long history of educating African Americans. This was largely because Philadelphia was a center of Quaker influence, and the Quakers believed strongly in equality. The city ran seven schools for African American students by the year 1800. In 1820 Boston followed Philadelphiaâ€™s lead and opened a separate elementary school for African American children. The city began allowing them to attend school with whites in 1855.</p>
        <p data-uuid="78bae4d5982646d1a289e9c4b173b488"> African Americans rarely attended college because few colleges would accept them. In 1835 Oberlin College became the first to do so. Harvard University soon admitted African Americans, too. Several African American colleges were founded beginning in the 1840s. In 1842 the Institute for Colored Youth opened in Philadelphia. Avery College, also in Pennsylvania, was founded in 1849.<br />

        <p data-uuid="568abb2924a44b469d54f879c4f4b321">While free African Americans had some opportunities to attend school in the North and Midwest, few had this chance in the South. Laws in the South barred most enslaved people from getting any education, even at the primary school level. While some slaves learned to read on their own, they almost always did so in secret. Slaveholders were fearful that education and knowledge in general might encourage a spirit of revolt among enslaved African Americans.</p>
