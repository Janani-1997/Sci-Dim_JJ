        <p data-uuid="19f2a0fa7bec4a6ea07d690e54bd1792">People in the South believed their economy and way of life would be destroyed without slave labor. They reacted immediately. Within a week of Lincoln’s election, South Carolina’s legislature called for a special convention. The delegates considered secession. Southern secessionists believed that they had a right to leave the Union. They pointed out that each of the original states had voluntarily joined the Union by holding a special convention that had ratified the Constitution. Surely, they reasoned, states could leave the Union by the same process.</p>
        <p data-uuid="4b8de1846cb04f45b32d1986ebf3bbe5">Critics of secession thought this argument was ridiculous. President Buchanan said the Union was not “a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties.” President-elect Abraham Lincoln agreed, saying, “No State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union.” Lincoln added, “They can only do so against [the] law, and by revolution.”</p>
        <p data-uuid="2990f25b920d40bbb3e549271e848edd">While South Carolina representatives were meeting in Charleston to discuss secession, Congress examined a plan to save the Union. Senator <b><dfn title="Crittenden, John J.">John J. Crittenden</dfn></b> of Kentucky proposed a series of constitutional amendments that he believed would satisfy the South by protecting slavery. Crittenden hoped the country could avoid secession and a civil war.</p>
        <p data-uuid="ffaef57a41b64d3bba1a0496d548f270">Lincoln disagreed with Crittenden’s plan. He believed there could be no compromise about the extension of slavery. Lincoln wrote, “The tug has to come and better now than later.” A Senate committee voted on Crittenden’s plan, and every Republican rejected it, as Lincoln had requested.</p>
        <h3 data-uuid="0a7583963676490d991de66ee8b6a9d1">The Confederate States of America</h3>
        <p data-uuid="81c73c6ca869413a9222a1c04cefb273">South Carolina elected to dissolve “the union now subsisting [existing] between South Carolina and other States” on December 20, 1860. Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas also seceded to form the <b><dfn title="Confederate States of America">Confederate States of America</dfn></b>, also called the Confederacy. Its new constitution guaranteed citizens the right to own slaves.</p>
        <p data-uuid="8824d146ec7e42b5ae5eccbe64945240"> Delegates from seceded states elected <b><dfn title="Davis, Jefferson">Jefferson Davis</dfn></b> of Mississippi as president of the Confederacy. Davis had hoped to be the commanding general of Mississippi’s troops. He responded to the news of his election with reluctance.<br />

In writing his inaugural address, Lincoln looked to many of the nation’s founding documents. Referring to the idea that governments receive “their just powers from the consent of the governed,” a line from the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln stated, “This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember [take apart] or overthrow it. I can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous [wanting] of having the National Constitution amended. . . . ”</p>
